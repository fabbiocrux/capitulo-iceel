abstract = {Nitrate, the most oxidized form of nitrogen, is regulated to protect people and animals from harmful levels as there is a large over abundance due to anthropogenic factors. Widespread field testing for nitrate could begin to address the nitrate pollution problem, however, the Cadmium Reduction Method, the leading certified method to detect and quantify nitrate, demands the use of a toxic heavy metal. An alternative, the recently proposed Environmental Protection Agency Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method, eliminates this problem but requires an expensive proprietary spectrophotometer. The development of an inexpensive portable, handheld photometer will greatly expedite field nitrate analysis to combat pollution. To accomplish this goal, a methodology for the design, development, and technical validation of an improved open-source water testing platform capable of performing Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method. This approach is evaluated for its potential to i) eliminate the need for toxic chemicals in water testing for nitrate and nitrite, ii) reduce the cost of equipment to perform this method for measurement for water quality, and iii) make the method easier to carryout in the field. The device is able to perform as well as commercial proprietary systems for less than 15{\%} of the cost for materials. This allows for greater access to the technology and the new, safer nitrate testing technique.},

The study uses an exploratory scenario planning, an inductive approach to engage FMCG industry organisations, CE experts, end-users, and academic stakeholders in exploring the future of FMCG within a CE context. Five future scenarios that can inform a vision for the future of the FMCG industry were developed: (1) Rinse and Reuse, (2) The Cycling of Pure Materials, (3) The Rise of the Circular Retailer, (4) A World Without Supermarkets and (5) Connected Living. The analysis and discussion of the scenarios consider how value is created within circular economy and the integral role that the consumer and the IT play within it. The study provides insights on how the FMCG sector might participate in the CE and in doing so provides a basis for further research in this area. Future areas for research are outlined.},

@article{Ordonez2015,
abstract = {In order to increase resource recovery from solid waste, better sorting of household waste is needed. This article reports on a case study about waste sorting infrastructure performance carried out in two buildings in Gothenburg, Sweden. Results from the study reveal mismatches between users' needs and what the system offers, affecting the sorting rates and quality of the sorted material. Frequent sorting errors were observed from the tenants in these apartment buildings, where more than 70{\%} of the discards that go in the mixed waste could be sorted out into other available fractions, with biodegradable waste being the most neglected. Hazardous waste was often discarded wrongly and recurrent errors were observed in the containers available for sorting different packaging material. Given the performance observed, initial suggestions are made for housing companies to rethink the sorting system they offer to their tenants (i.e. accessible space for electronic waste, more space for biodegradable waste, possibility of sorting textiles, etc.). Most importantly this paper makes the case that housing companies have the opportunity to provide sorting infrastructure that is designed for the user, rather than just fitted to the waste management system.},

abstract = {This article reports a new process chain for custom-made three-dimensional (3D) porous ceramic scaffolds for bone replacement with fully interconnected channel network for the repair of osseous defects from trauma or disease. Rapid prototyping and especially 3D printing is well suited to generate complex-shaped porous ceramic matrices directly from powder materials. Anatomical information obtained from a patient can be used to design the implant for a target defect. In the 3D printing technique, a box filled with ceramic powder is printed with a polymer-based binder solution layer by layer. Powder is bonded in wetted regions. Unglued powder can be removed and a ceramic green body remains. We use a modified hydroxyapatite (HA) powder for the fabrication of 3D printed scaffolds due to the safety of HA as biocompatible implantable material and efficacy for bone regeneration. The printed ceramic green bodies are consolidated at a temperature of 1250 degrees C in a high temperature furnace in ambient air. The polymeric binder is pyrolysed during sintering. The resulting scaffolds can be used in tissue engineering of bone implants using patient-derived cells that are seeded onto the scaffolds. This article describes the process chain, beginning from data preparation to 3D printing tests and finally sintering of the scaffold. Prototypes were successfully manufactured and characterized. It was demonstrated that it is possible to manufacture parts with inner channels with a dimension down to 450 microm and wall structures with a thickness down to 330 microm. The mechanical strength of dense test parts is up to 22 MPa.},

abstract = {The sustainable human resource management literature provides arguments linking the social sustainability dimensions of business and society, suggesting a circular or two-way relationship between them. The norm of reciprocity builds social sustainability by increasing trust and cooperation in any group of people and explains this complex relationship. In this study, we test the connection between society––poverty and inequality––and business––human resource investment strategy––using a large longitudinal data set with six time points. Findings showed that past poverty negatively contributes to a later human resource investment strategy and vice versa. This mutual relationship configures a positive feedback loop where environmental social sustainability and organizational social sustainability enhance each other. Results also show that a human resource investment strategy negatively affects income inequality, revealing that corporate decisions on social sustainability can affect social sustainability in society.},

@article{Zanardini2016,
abstract = {This paper is a focus study to introduce an alternative approach to the existing ones, which could be taken to implement Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems for industrial applications. This approach is mainly based on the use of Product Service Systems (PSS) concept in order to turn AM into a more relevant field for service-based purposes within industrial applications. To do so, an AM profile, which is characterized with the similar notions forming the conceptual basis of PSS is detailed, and then the profile is framed for the new service oriented approach to highlight AM's competences in this field. Having found the interconnecting links between these two concepts, the intended approach for implementation would then be discussed and further developed in more detail to include the best use cases of the previous AM case studies as a guide on how to exploit AM's capabilities in similar ways, only modified for a given industrial business which is based on service development. The use cases would also introduce a few of the most successful examples in the production-service systems which have already taken advantage of three-dimensional printing (3D printing) which is one the subcategories of AM in lower tier (desktop) applications. These customer scale applications of 3D printing alongside portfolio analysis of AM in the field of industrial services could shed light for implementing further service-centric research in the advanced manufacturing systems.},

abstract = {Millions of Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) are consumed annually by soldiers around the world. This results in the generation of thousands of tons of residual polymeric packaging waste, which is either left behind in the environment or otherwise recycled or incinerated at a cost of several millions of U.S. dollars per year. Advancements in distributed recycling technologies now allow for on-demand reconstitution of traditionally neglected MRE pouch waste into useful appliances via material extrusion additive manufacturing. In this work, we demonstrate recycling of MRE pouch materials through a combined compounding, filament extrusion, and fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing protocol. Mechanical properties and barrier properties of additively manufactured structures were evaluated through tensile testing and water vapor transmission testing, respectively, and found to be comparable to the native pouch materials. Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetric Analysis of the extruded filament and printed materials were contrasted with native pouch materials, showing minimal effects of the manufacturing process on critical thermal transitions in the polymer. Economics and viability of on-demand reconstitution using these proposed methods are briefly discussed and reveal the multiple benefits of this recycling process.},

These include polymer chemistry and physics, process engineering and manufacturing engineering. This paper presents a concise background of the current state of knowledge with respect to POSTC-PET recycling covering the disciplines mentioned above. In the first section of this paper, a brief background is presented about virgin PET synthesis, thermal transitions, processing and applications. The second section covers the PET recycling process with a focus on contamination and ways to increase the molecular weight of recycled PET (R-PET). It serves as an introduction to Section 3 where the chain extension process is described in detail. In Section 3, the current understanding of chain extenders, chain extension experimentation variables and equipment is reviewed. Reactive extrusion process is described in Section 4 with a special focus on system stability under chain extension conditions. Section 5 covers the effect of chain extension on R-PET thermal transitions and crystallinity. Section 6 presents the injection stretch blow moulding (ISBM) process as a possible application for R-PET with a focus on preform and bottle moulding. The last section gives a description of FT-IR technology to detect bottles' orientation and conformation changes. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a framework to re-think and widen the theoretical assumptions behind so-called weak signal theory in futures studies. This paper suggests that the present understanding of weak signals views the topic as a question of linear emergence, that is, a sequence of development that perceives the topic evolving from an embryo towards a full-blown future issue or trend. However, this viewpoint does not take into account the context and perspective – or positionality – of the perceiver. This issue has, we argue, wide-ranging effects on the identification and interpretation of weak signals. Thus, as a response to this gap, we outline a relational theory of futures knowledge that aims to consider this missing theoretical baseline and widen the understanding of the nature and formation of weak signals. The theory builds on selected tenets of behavioural economics, psychology, human geography and anthropology. This paper outlines the principles of current weak signal theory and depicts the relational theory. It also provides selected empirical examples to emphasise the points made.},

abstract = {Summary Three Dimensional Printing is a process for the manufacture of tooling and functional prototype parts directly from computer models. Three Dimensional Printing functions by the deposition of powdered material in layers and the selective binding of the powder by “ink-jet” printing of a binder material. Following the sequential application of layers, the unbound powder is removed, resulting in a complex three-dimensional part. The process may be applied to the production of metal, ceramic, and metal/ceramic composite parts. An experiment employing continuous-jet ink-jet printing technology has produced a three-dimensional part comprising eight intersecting planes spaced 0.375 inches apart. Future research will be directed toward the direct fabrication of cores and shells for metal casting, and toward the fabrication of porous ceramic preforms for metal-ceramic composite parts.},

It is thus necessary for local authorities to adopt the best practices, and to take informed decisions in order to move towards more sustainable urban development projects. But today the challenge lies in the involvement of all the stakeholders in the project, each with specific needs and different points of view in a given context. Thereby learning and awareness for sustainable development is necessary. This research helps to highlight the appropriate tools that meet these challenges of education and learning for sustainable development leading towards a shared vision for all stakeholders. “Serious games” seem to be a relevant trail of investigation and development.},

Creativity takes place in a physical context, i.e. in a confined space. Such space restricts and enables the free flow of sensory experiences and proximity of other people. The confinements may make certain sensory experiences available, e.g. vision of source material, sight and sound (including noise). This framing allows certain cognitive processes and restricts others. This may induce emotions that, in turn, facilitate or reduce the enhancement of creativity. Physical space affects the well-being of people, the channels of information, the availability of knowledge tools and sets the stage for coherence and continuity, which may contribute to competitive advantages.},

abstract = {Locally productive, globally connected self-sufcient cities Abstract More than 200 years since the Industrial Revolution, global urbanisation keeps accelerating. United Nations projections indicate that 75{\%} of the human population will be living in cities by 2050. Newly created cities and the urbanisation process in rural areas replicates a lifestyle based on consumerism and the linear economy, causing destructive social and economic impact, while compromising the ecological systems of the planet. We are losing livelihoods through both offshoring and automation, and this in turn leads to the demise of dynamic hubs of practical and cultural knowledge, where things are made. Extreme industrialisation and globalisation have turned cities into the most voracious consumers of materials, and they are overwhelmingly the source of carbon emissions through both direct and embodied energy consumption; we need to reimagine the cities and how they operate. The Fab City is an international initiative started by IAAC, MIT's CBA, the Barcelona City Council and the Fab Foundation to develop locally productive and globally connected self-sufcient cities. The project is connected to the global Fab Lab (Fabrication Laboratory) Network and comprises an international think tank of civic leaders, makers, urbanists and innovators working on changing the paradigm of the current industrial economy where the city operates on a linear model of importing products and producing waste, to a spiral innovation ecosystem in which materials ow inside cities and information on how things are made circulates globally. Fab City is about building a new economy based on distributed data and manufacturing infrastructure.},

The study was conducted using a set of different nozzles (0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mm) and a range of layer heights from the minimum to maximum physical limits of the machine. To assess print strength, a novel assessment method is proposed. A tubular sample is loaded in the weakest direction (across layers) in a three-point bending fixture. Mesostructure evaluation through scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) scans of the samples was used to explain the obtained results. We detected a significant influence of geometric process parameters on sample mesostructure, and consequently, on sample strength.},

Further, the various mechanisms in which AM may contribute to an increase in job creation as well as the types of jobs are analyzed. The analysis also goes beyond AM technologies and incorporates other non-technological factors which foster job creation, i.e. higher wages in BRIC countries, lower quality in BRIC countries, and a rising demand for western-made products. The analysis is based on a case study and the data collected was through interviews with three prominent actors within the AM technologies field in Sweden: technology developers, leading suppliers and users. The main findings indicate that AM (i) contributes to job creation in both the manufacturing sector and in the service sector, (ii) does not bring back mass production jobs from emerging economies such as BRIC, (iii) contributes to job creation in product development stages (e.g. rapid prototyping), and (iv) contributes to job creation in production stages of low-volume batches mainly of complex products. The findings also suggest there are barriers for full exploitation of AM in several areas, including education systems.},

abstract = {Production and maker spaces are increasingly generating mixed plastic material waste of varying quality from 3-D printers. Industrial interest is growing in embedding granulated recycled particulate material additives into a virgin binding matrix. Examples include the introduction of granulated mixed recycled materials into 3-D printer material, concrete, and pavement. The stress load-sharing between the particulate additive and the binding matrix is an important factor in design and development of these composite materials. With mixed material additives, a designer is interested in the variation of such predicted load-sharing. However, experimental development is costly and time-consuming, thus analytical and semi-analytical estimates are desired for accelerated development. In this work, we expand on previous analytically correlated phase-averaged micro- and macrostructural loading to include variational effects present in mixed recycled material. In addition, model trade-offs are provided to aid designers in quickly selecting application specific mixtures. This framework identifies the stress contributions, and their variation, to reduce product development time and costs, which could greatly accelerate material recycling and reuse for improved infrastructure materials, low-cost 3-D printer filament, and reduced waste towards a more circular economy.},

abstract = {Combining sustainable consumption with the circular economy concept could help tackle challenges, such as resource scarcity and climate change by reducing resource throughput and increasing cycling of products and materials within the economic system, thereby reducing emissions and virgin material use. To achieve sustainable consumption in a circular economy production and consumption practices need to change. Business models can potentially influence both practices as it defines how a company conducts business and shapes the company-consumer relationship. This paper developed future business models for sustainable consumption through two rounds of semi-structured interviews with experts from academia, industry, and policy. During the first interview round, four business model elements that are important for sustainable consumption were identified: Resource strategy, Revenue model, Consumer effort, and Objective to (decrease/increase) consumption level. Based on these elements, we developed a comprehensive business model framework. Using this framework, experts envisioned future business models for sustainable consumption of clothing during the second interview round. The findings of this study suggest that the most promising business models for sustainable consumption are those that reduce overall consumption levels and consumer effort. Further, we found that a diverse range of business models in the market can potentially enable different customer segments to consume sustainably.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional printing (3DP) represents a relative novel technology in manufacturing which is associated with potentially strong stimuli for sustainable development. Until now, research has merely assessed case study-related potentials of 3DP and described specific aspects of 3DP. This study represents the first comprehensive assessment of 3DP from a global sustainability perspective. It contains a qualitative assessment of 3DP-induced sustainability implications and quantifies changes in life cycle costs, energy and CO2 emissions globally by 2025. 3DP is identified to cost-effectively lower manufacturing inputs and outputs in markets with low volume, customized and high-value production chains as aerospace and medical component manufacturing. This lowers energy use, resource demands and related CO2 emissions over the entire product life cycle, induces changes in labour structures and generates shifts towards more digital and localized supply chains. The model calculations show that 3DP contains the potential to reduce costs by 170-593 billion US {\$}, the total primary energy supply by 2.54-9.30 EJ and CO2 emissions by 130.5-525.5 Mt by 2025. The great range within the saving potentials can be explained with the immature state of the technology and the associated uncertainties of predicting market and technology developments. The energy and CO2 emission intensities of industrial manufacturing are reducible by maximally 5{\%} through 3DP by 2025, as 3DP remains a niche technology. If 3DP was applicable to larger production volumes in consumer products or automotive manufacturing, it contains the (theoretical) potential to absolutely decouple energy and CO2 emission from economic activity.},

The results revealed that for graduates, source separation was driven by social responsibilities and family size while council awareness campaign, financial incentives and provision of recycling facilities are the driving force for source separation amongst respondents with matric and lower formal education. Family size and level of education are correlated to attitude with low correlations. The weak correlation was due to the perception of quality of services provided by the council. Incentives are moderators of intention of source separation but distances to buyback centre have to be carefully selected in order not to be a deterrent. Waste management agencies should accommodate the level of formal education and different family size in the formulation of source separation program.},

abstract = {A method for predicting the optimal conditions for polymer extrusion, which relies only on gramscale laboratory experiments for two commercial polystyrene samples with two molecular weights is demonstrated by oscillatory rheology. These enable a shear viscosity map vs. temperature and shear rate to be constructed, together with the positions for the major molecular timescales. Alternative methods for characterising rheology, including melt flow index and capillary rheology measurements were also employed, but these do not give the same level of understanding of flow behaviour. The capillary tests generates die swell and this complex behaviour can be seen to collapse onto a single line regardless of temperature when plotted using the Rouse–Weissenberg number. The full shear viscosity map, together with the polymer timescales serves as a design tool to predict processing behaviour for melt processors. The work represents and builds on major academic-industry collaborative research programmes.},

Based on its technical background – the ink jet printing as known from the printer and plotter industry – a classification structure has been developed and proposed. Different printing techniques and process concepts, together with their advantages and limitations are described and analysed. A large variety of manufacturing applications such as rapid pattern making and rapid tooling using the 3DP process directly or as core technology, as well as further implications in design and engineering analysis, medicine, and architecture are presented and evaluated. Some research issues are also discussed. An attempt, based on the state of the art, to show weaknesses and opportunities, and to draw conclusions about the future of this},

abstract = {In this article we propose the EcoPrinting technology, which aims at a near zero carbon foot print means of recycling waste polymers into functional, working products. To achieve this goal, we demonstrate a nanogrid device by which solar energy can be stored in a modest sized battery system and use this to power instrumentation for melt extrusion of waste polymers into 3D printer filaments. We then use this filament in a modified 3D printer system to manufacture functional humanitarian aid components such as water seals and pipe connectors. We investigate the feasibility of the EcoPrinting principal using ABS and HDPE plastics, while evaluating and optimizing enabling device energy consumption and manufacturing performance. We conclude that the EcoPrinting principal is possible and functional devices can be manufactured with mechanical integrity equivalent to commercially available components. We finally demonstrate that EcoPrinting can be used as a tool for humanitarian use, realizing a manufacturing paradigm that is self-sufficient and potentially capable of addressing challenges of plastic proliferation in developing nations. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {One of the interesting questions in the field of social sciences is to explain why nations produce science advances and new technology that generate economic and social change. This paper endeavors to clarify some drivers of science and technology (S{\&}T) of nations. The thesis of this paper is that nations produce science advances and new technology to endorse a socio economic power and leadership directed to take advantage of important opportunities or to cope with environmental threats in competitive settings. In general, science advances and new technology are due to organized social and economic efforts of nations to achieve breakthroughs directed to support national interests of institutions and wellbeing of population. In particular, the production of science advances and new technology is driven by individuals, which have the natural tendency to seek out novelty and challenges, to explore, to learn and to achieve goals within efficient organizations in line with national interests. Preliminary empirical evidence here seems to support the factors underlying motivations of nations to produce science advances and new technology in society. Overall, then this paper may form a ground work for development of more sophisticated studies and theoretical frameworks that explain the drivers of S{\&}T in society.},

abstract = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is an important process among the available additive manufacturing technologies in various industries. Although there exists many works investigating the effects of FDM process parameters on the mechanical properties of printed materials, there are still several points need to be studied. One is the effects of process parameters on the dynamic mechanical properties of FDM-printed materials, especially in environments where the temperature often changes. The other is the mechanism by which process parameters affect the mechanical properties of printed materials. Aiming at these two points, uniaxial tensile tests and dynamic mechanical analysis are carried out respectively to characterize the tensile properties and dynamic mechanical properties of FDM-printed PLA materials under different FDM process parameters, namely printing angle, layer thickness, fill rate and nozzle temperature. Based on the experimental results explanations are given for the influence of the FDM process parameters on the mechanical properties of the printed materials.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the emissions characteristics of hazardous material during fused deposition modeling type 3D printing. Particulate and gaseous materials were measured before, during, and after 3D printing in an exposure chamber. One ABS and two PLA (PLA1 and PLA2) cartridges were tested three times. For online monitoring, a scanning mobility particle sizer, light scattering instrument, and total volatile organic compound (TVOC) monitor were employed and a polycarbonate filter and various adsorbent tubes were used for offline sampling. The particle concentration of 3D printing using ABS material was 33−38 times higher than when PLA materials were used. Most particles were nanosize ({\textless}100 nm) during ABS (96{\%}) and PLA1 (98{\%}) use, but only 12{\%} were nanosize for PLA2. The emissions rates were 1.61 × 1010 ea/min and 1.67 × 1011 ea/g cartridge with the ABS cartridge and 4.27−4.89 × 108 ea/min and 3.77−3.91 × 109 ea/g cartridge with the PLA cartridge. TVOCs were also emitted when the ABS was used (GM; 155 ppb, GSD; 3.4), but not when the PLA cartridges were used. Our results suggest that more research and sophisticated control methods, including the use of less harmful materials, blocking emitted containments, and using filters or adsorbents, should be implemented.},

abstract = {The rapid urbanization progress and the continuous improvement of rural residents' living standard contribute to the increase of rural solid waste (RSW) in China. Based on direct face-to-face interview, a questionnaire survey consisting of 518 valid samples was performed to investigate rural households' behaviors towards RSW treatment and their perceptions in terms of awareness, attitudes on source-separated collection of RSW. Contingent valuation method (CVM) was employed to estimate respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) for RSW separation and management. Results indicated that some rural households had spontaneously separated the recyclable waste and food waste to some extent. The public were aware of the importance of RSW separation through various media. Further, more than half of households were willing to participate in the separation program. The dominant barriers of participation were the lack of awareness of separation, inconvenience and insufficient separation facility (53.7{\%}). In addition, 62.5{\%} of rural households had a positive WTP for RSW separation and management and the mean WTP was estimated to be 26.4 CNY/year. Age, annual household income and location significantly influenced the respondents' WTP. Therefore, we suggest that policy makers implement the pilot programs of RSW separation at source accordingly and devote efforts to providing collection service and improving RSW management by combining government financial budget and rural households' payment.},

A threshold value of 10 g (10 min)−1 (2.16 kg; ISO 1133) is put forward for a successful printing (190–220°C), enabling a fast and practical screening of PLA materials. It is however shown that a sole focus on MFI is insufficient, as the plasticiser type and crystallinity also play a role after the polymer melt deposition. The latter is supported by scanning electron micromorphology and differential scanning calorimetry measurements. In particular, blending with poly(hydroxyl butyrate) (PHB; 20 m{\%}) allows to control both MFI and crystallinity without the need for annealing.},

The existing design criteria of products have various approach which affected on how to manage abundant plastic waste with no or very low value of materials that has been generated by daily consumption of plastic packaging. Otherwise, the proposed design criteria conserve the material value systematically which make the post use materials of plastic packaging more financially feasible as raw materials in plastic recycling industry.

abstract = {Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a promising additive manufacturing technology and an alternative of conventional processes for the fabrication of fibre reinforced composites due to its ability to build functional parts having complex geometries. Continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTPCs) are becoming more significant in industrial applications due to their inherit advantages such as excellent mechanical performance, recycling and potential lightweight structures [1,2]. However, a major concern affecting the efficient use of 3D printed composites is the effect of impact damage on the structural integrity, compared to conventional pre-preg composites. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of build orientation, layer thickness and fibre volume content on the impact performance of 3D printed continuous carbon, glass, and Kevlar{\textregistered}fibre reinforced nylon composites, manufactured by FDM technique. Charpy impact tests are carried out to determine impact strength. SEM images of fractured surfaces are examined to assess failure mechanics of the different configurations. It is observed that the effect of layer thickness of nylon samples on the impact performance was different for flat and on-edge samples. Impact strength increases as layer thickness increases in flat samples but, conversely, it decreases in on-edge samples, depicting a more brittle fracture. In addition, the results show that impact strength increases as fibre volume content increases in most cases. Glass fibre reinforced samples exhibits the highest impact strength and carbon fibre reinforced samples the lowest one and similar to nylon performance. Furthermore, on-edge reinforced samples exhibit higher values of impact strength than flat reinforced samples. Finally, the results obtained demonstrate that impact strength exhibited by 3D printed composites are significantly higher than the usual 3D printed thermoplastics and, in some cases, even better than common pre-preg materials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Exponential development of minimally invasive techniques, such as robotic-assisted devices, raises the question of how to assess robotic surgery skills. Early development of virtual simulators has provided efficient tools for laparoscopic skills certification based on objective scoring, high availability, and lower cost. However, similar evaluation is lacking for robotic training. The purpose of this study was to assess several criteria, such as reliability, face, content, construct, and concurrent validity of a new virtual robotic surgery simulator. METHODS This prospective study was conducted from December 2009 to April 2010 using three simulators dV-Trainers({\textregistered}) (MIMIC Technologies({\textregistered})) and one Da Vinci S({\textregistered}) (Intuitive Surgical({\textregistered})). Seventy-five subjects, divided into five groups according to their initial surgical training, were evaluated based on five representative exercises of robotic specific skills: 3D perception, clutching, visual force feedback, EndoWrist({\textregistered}) manipulation, and camera control. Analysis was extracted from (1) questionnaires (realism and interest), (2) automatically generated data from simulators, and (3) subjective scoring by two experts of depersonalized videos of similar exercises with robot. RESULTS Face and content validity were generally considered high (77 {\%}). Five levels of ability were clearly identified by the simulator (ANOVA; p = 0.0024). There was a strong correlation between automatic data from dV-Trainer and subjective evaluation with robot (r = 0.822). Reliability of scoring was high (r = 0.851). The most relevant criteria were time and economy of motion. The most relevant exercises were Pick and Place and Ring and Rail. CONCLUSIONS The dV-Trainer({\textregistered}) simulator proves to be a valid tool to assess basic skills of robotic surgery.},

On the other side, considering environmental aspects in design is beneficial as it leads to lower costs, improved product quality, new business oppor-tunities. Thus, in order to foster the potential of AM in product innovation and product manufacturing in the light of environmental concerns, a new design method is necessary. This paper proposes a method in the context of Design with Additive Manufacturing, to take into account the specifici-ties of this manufacturing process in a Design to Environment approach. The method is focused on the Early Design Stages (EDS) of the product development process, which are cru-cial not only for choices regarding the product characteristics but also for the environmental parameters that need to be taken into consideration. The implementation of the proposed method in creativity session of the EDS underlined the need for dedicated supports in terms of environmental decisions. More and specifically the need for providing tools to capital-ize the decisions made focusing on each Life Cycle Stage of the product was identified as a requirement for this support.},

abstract = {Industrial symbiosis (IS) has attracted the attention of practitioners and researchers since 1972, with its inception in an industrial park in Kalundborg, Denmark. IS involves traditionally separate entities working collaboratively by exchanging wastes and sharing resources to gain competitive advantage. This collaboration among separate entities has a significant impact on the structure of supply chains and the relationships among the participating entities. In the literature, studies address IS from ecology, energy, environmental science, and materials management perspectives. However, there are not many papers that explore IS from the supply chain management perspective. In this paper, we first introduce the definition of symbiotic supply chains and provide a review and taxonomy of scholarly works in this area. We find that the majority of the researchers focus on self-organized and facilitated IS at the strategic/tactical symbiotic supply chain levels. Specifically, institutional capacity, i.e., qualitative factors that impact the capability of a group of firms to reach solutions, is explored extensively. Finally, we propose a research agenda that serves as a single source for researchers interested in exploring symbiotic supply chains.},

abstract = {Natural resources are limited and society has long been unwisely consuming them, while Earth has been longing for care. Most existing businesses are based on linear models and a transition to Circular Business Models is necessary. Circular Business Models are business models that enable systems that are regenerative by nature; they seek maintaining resource value at its maximum for as long as feasible, and eliminating or reducing resource leakage, by closing, slowing, or narrowing resource flows. For a transition to circular business models to happen, researchers and practitioners need to know how to implement and manage them. Therefore, this paper's aim is threefold: (i) identify researchers, topics of highlight and journals housing research on Circular Business Models worldwide, (ii) identify the main aspects that influence Circular Business Model implementation, and (iii) point the unaddressed subjects in the existing literature on Circular Business Models. To that end, a systematic literature review was conducted. The EndNote, Microsoft Power BI, and the VOSviewer software tools were used to manage references and build visual maps, respectively. Resource flow management, considerations on surpluses, system orientation, challenges to circular business models, system design aspects, influence of company size, possible rebound effects, customer consideration, company's culture and behavior, and capacity building for CE have been the main aspects of current concern on circular business model investigation. The importance of increasing circularity through circular business models is mainly addressed through the importance of top management support and its action from the company's core to the outside. Further investigations and partnerships from theoreticians and practitioners are expected to assist the evolution of the theme.},

Second, to explore the perceptions of Chilean users of new technologies to classify and compare them with users from the USA. Data were collected in two Chilean regions through a face-to-face survey with a final sample size of 788 respondents. Latent class analysis was used as a segmentation tool. We obtained five groups of users: pioneers, hesitators, avoiders, explorers, and skeptics. The clusters found in this current study are to some extent similar to those obtained in the pioneering research conducted in the USA, although there are differences in their order of importance. These findings can help companies to adopt innovations to specific market segments. As a result, the rate of success of these innovations would improve.},

abstract = {Limited material options, prohibitively expensive equipment, and high production costs currently limit the ability of small and medium enterprises to use 3D printing to prototype and manufacture metallic goods. A low-cost open-source 3D metal printer that utilizes gas metal arc welding technology has been developed that could make metal printing accessible to the average consumer. Unfortunately, this technology would demand access to expensive cutting tools for part removal from the substrate. This article investigates several substrate treatments to provide a low-cost method to easily remove 3D-printed 1100 aluminum parts from a reusable substrate. Coatings of aluminum oxide and boron nitride on 1100 aluminum and A36 low-carbon steel substrates were tested. Lap shear tests were performed to assess the interlayer adhesion between the printed metal part and the print substrate. No warping of the substrate was observed during printing. It was determined that boron nitride-coated low-carbon steel provided the lowest adhesion strength. Printing aluminum on uncoated low-carbon steel also allowed easy removal of the aluminum part with the benefit of no additional coating steps or costs.},

The paper is the result of a collaborative process among several open innovation scholars—having a common basis in the recurrent Professional Development Workshop (PDW) on “Researching Open Innovation” at the Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management. In this paper, we present opportunities for future research on open innovation, organized at different levels of analysis. We discuss some of the contingencies at these different levels, and argue that future research needs to study open innovation— originally an organizational-level phenomenon—across multiple levels of analysis. While our integrative framework allows comparing, contrasting, and integrating different perspectives at different levels of analysis, further theorizing will be needed to advance open innovation research. On this basis, we propose some new research categories as well as questions for future research— particularly those that span across research domains that have so far developed in isolation.},

@article{Giampietro2020,
abstract = {This paper explores the implications of the widespread success of the term circular economy in the institutional and public debate. The concept of circular economy in itself implies a logical contradiction: on the one hand, the concept acknowledges the dependence of the economy on biophysical flows; on the other hand, the proposed solution—a business model guaranteeing a full decoupling of the economy from natural resources—seemingly ignores that biophysical processes are subject to thermodynamic constraints. A biophysical view of the sustainability predicament—the flows exchanged between the technosphere and the biosphere — is depicted to show that the idea of a full decoupling is simply due to ignorance of the knowledge generated in (inter)disciplinary scientific fields other than the dominant economic one. The success of economics as an ‘elite folk science' is explained by the need of the establishment to ignore uncomfortable knowledge that would destabilize existing institutions. The success of the term circular economy can be seen as an example of socially constructed ignorance in which folk tales are used to depoliticize the sustainability debate and to colonize the future through the endorsement of implausible socio-technical imaginaries. A strategy that can lead to an irresponsible management of expectation: implausible master narratives are impossible to govern. Rather than continuing to impose technocratic plans, as if we knew the optimal thing to do, Post-Normal Science suggests that it is much more effective and responsible to adopt a flexible management approach, exploring the ability of self-organization of social-ecological systems.},

Little attention to the surface quality obtained in additive manufacturing processes has been paid by the research community. So, this paper aims at filling this gap. The goal of the study is the recognition of critical factors in FDM processes for reducing surface roughness. Two different types of experiments were carried out to analyze five printing parameters. The results were analyzed by means of Analysis of Variance, graphical methods, and non-parametric tests using Spearman's $\rho$ and Kendall's $\tau$ correlation coefficients. The results showed how layer height and wall thickness are the most important factors for controlling surface roughness, while printing path, printing speed, and temperature showed no clear influence on surface roughness.},

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to identify and develop a hierarchical model for the barriers affecting the growth of mobile commerce (M-commerce). Based on the model developed, the authors' objective is to identify those variables that are of strategic nature and are the root cause of the issue. Design/methodology/approach – Variables considered as barriers are identified, and utilizing the interpretive structural model approach, a relationship model is developed. Further, the impact matrix cross-reference multiplication applied to a classification approach is used to analyze the effect and dependence among these factors. Findings – The research in the area of M-commerce in the Arab world and related to the strategic aspect is limited in the extant literature. The present study tries to fill this gap by investigating the variables that inhibit the growth of M-commerce in Qatar. The research shows that there exists a group of barriers having a high driving power and low dependence requiring maximum attention and of strategic importance, while another group consists of those variables that have high dependence and are the resultant actions. Practical implications – There is a growing concern that although the numbers of mobile subscribers are increasing at a very fast pace in Qatar, actual M-commerce activities in the country remain low. The findings of this study can be used to understand the differences between the independent and dependent variables and their mutual relationships. The study would also help the policy makers to develop suitable strategies to facilitate growth of M-commerce in the country. Originality/value – This research was the first attempt to investigate the relationships among the variables inhibiting the growth of M-commerce in a fast-growing economy in a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Given that there is limited research on M-commerce in the GCC context, the study can be viewed as an investigation that provides a good understanding of the variables and their interrelationships affecting M-commerce proliferation.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{CruzSanchez2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V. Nowadays, the low recycling rate of polymers is still a challenge to humankind due to energy, economic and logistical issues. In the context of additive manufacturing, there is an exponential use of thermoplastic materials in the industrial and public open-source additive manufacturing sector, leading to an increase in global polymer consumption and waste generation. However, the coupling of the open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process. It could be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of centralized recycling of polymers, which is often uneconomical and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. In order to achieve this goal, a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing feedstock. The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, a general methodology to evaluate the recyclability of thermoplastics used as feedstock in open-source 3D printing machines is proposed. Then, the proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic acid (PLA) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique, which is currently the most widely used. The main results of this application contribute to the understanding of the influence of the material's physico-chemical degradation on its mechanical properties as well as its potential distributed recyclability.},

abstract = {Narrative literature reviews serve a vital scientific function, but few resources help people learn to write them. As compared with empirical reports, literature reviews can tackle broader and more abstract questions, can engage in more post hoc theorizing without the danger of capitalizing on chance, can make a stronger case for a null-hypothesis conclusion, and can appreciate and use methodological diversity better. Also, literature reviews can draw any of 4 conclusions: The hypothesis is correct, it has not been conclusively established but is the currently best guess, it is false, or the evidence permits no conclusion. Common mistakes of authors of literature review manuscripts are described.},

A pedagogical experiment was conducted with the participation of 746 second to fourth year students majoring in engineering at the Ural Federal University in Russia. The coefficients for the relative importance of professional competencies were obtained through expert assessment. The number of experts was 40 faculty members with teaching experience of more than five years. The pedagogical experiment revealed the regularities of the influence of the forms of distance learning on the formation of students' professional competency levels. The values of students' developmental competency levels have been determined. Non-linear regression models have been developed based on the values of the integral level of professional competencies and the percentage of distance-learning forms in the number of instructional hours. The proposed methodological approach will be useful for university professors and teachers in identifying the most effective forms of distance learning and in differentiating teaching methods not only in the context of the general pandemic but also in the natural conditions of the educational process.},

abstract = {Recycled tire rubber is an environmentally and economically beneficial material. Ground tire rubber (GTR) as a filler in a polymer matrix was used as an ink material (composite material) for material extrusion in a 3D printing process. The maximum allowable amount of GTR incorporated into the mixture without significantly altering the rheological behavior of the ink was set. Printability investigations revealed that pressure and speed show linear and power relationships, respectively, to the line width for three different amounts of GTR. Moreover, the post-curing time of 30 min at 115 °C was set as the full-cure condition to achieve polymerization of 80{\%} or more for the 3D printed parts. Unidirectional tensile testing demonstrated that 3D printed specimens exhibit no degradation in tensile strength when compared to molded specimens. Moreover, printability and mechanical properties of functionalized GTR were investigated to determine if this material exhibits enhanced mechanical strength. Unidirectional tensile tests show that the maximum tensile strength for specimens with functionalized GTR was 20{\%} higher than in specimens with non-functionalized GTR. In conclusion, 3D printing of GTR composites shows promise for using recycled GTR to create 3D structures with rubber-like properties. {\textcopyright} 2019, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.},

abstract = {Improving the quality and capture of materials collected for recycling is at the top of the waste agenda for many English local authorities. In recent years, the focus has shifted away from general awareness raising techniques in favour of methods that can bring about behaviour change. This paper reports on three projects each using a different behaviour change based approach, which all aimed to increase participation in the recycling collection scheme and to reduce inclusion of non-targeted materials ("contamination"). The three projects-one doorstepping-based, one incentives-based and one delivering personalised feedback to residents were carried out in Portsmouth between 2005 and 2006 during a period where there were no major changes to the collection infrastructure. The findings show that personalised incentives and feedback were highly effective at reducing contamination. Both methods resulted in a halving of the number of households setting out contaminants on collection day. The feedback approach was considerably more cost-effective than the other two approaches, costing ∼{\pounds}0.50 per household to implement the campaign and averaging ∼{\pounds}3.00 for every household which subsequently displayed behaviour change. There was little improvement in the quality of collected materials attributed to doorstepping alone. None of the projects resulted in significant changes in recycling scheme participation; however, this may be because participation was initially high. These findings suggest that behaviour change is most effectively brought about using simple, low-cost methods to engage with residents at the point of service delivery, i.e. by the collection crews whilst emptying bins. The challenge now is to integrate this into service delivery as standard. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Data obtained in this study, by means of tensile, impact, and melt flow tests, GPC, gloss and colour analyses showed that the effect of UV exposure, whether in the field or artificial environments, was not significant as far as the mechanical properties of the materials were concerned. There was some change in the surface characteristics but such surface effects would not compromise the mechanical integrity of the product when recycled. During reprocessing of the materials, it is likely that stabilizer is redistributed at the surface of any new moulding, thus renewing the surface characteristics. Hence damaged or end-of-life products need not be discounted from recycling. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature. Despite significant advances and established advantages of material extrusion additive manufacturing, limitations still exist regarding ability to increase productivity and still maintain high shape fidelity and defect-free parts within the range of process parameter values that a 3D printer may support. In the present study, a predictive process-planning tool to balance productivity and quality of fabricated parts according to user's requirements is developed. Taguchi design of experiments (DoE) method is employed in order to determine the process parameters that impact shape fidelity in terms of material deposition stability that results in surfaces of acceptable flatness and defect-free parts. The development of four well-documented fabrication defects is quantified by CAD-to-part 3D comparison. Then, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to reveal, characteristically, that, even though reduced speed generally results in improved shape fidelity, defects arise when small layer thickness is also set. On the other hand, increased layer thickness may be coupled with moderate material deposition speed to improve process productivity without sacrificing part shape. A highly reliable artificial neural network (ANN) is constructed in an optimum way and trained on the previous experiments with the aim to predict shape fidelity across the entire factor level range. Hence, material flow rate which is a function of investigated factors is provided with direct feedback by the ANN regarding possible defects or deteriorated part shape. The method presented lays the basis for robust process optimization on any 3D printer.},

With over 80,000 materials, various manufacturing technologies (additive and traditional), diverse streams of application (aerospace, motor vehicles, health care, etc.), and high cost incurred due to manufacturability of the part, it has become essential to choose the right compromise of technology resource in early stages of design considering the Design for Manufacturing (DFM)/Design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM) guidelines. The concerned literature to date focuses on manufacturing technology selection by being either part specific or application specific. As multiple criteria are involved for decision making, this paper provides a thorough review on the following questions: (1) What are the common design criteria used in literature for additive and traditional manufacturing technologies with respect to product-process integration? (2) What is the literature contribution for material and manufacturing process selection strategies with special focus on comparison of additive and traditional manufacturing technologies? The paper attempts to provide as a result a basic generic methodology for resource selection (RS) which will not only take into account all of the areas of application, DFM/DFAM guidelines, and three design criteria (function, cost, and environment), but will also discuss avenues for collaborative product development. A complex industrial case study is also presented to test the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {Global awareness of material sustainability has increased the demand for bio-based polymers like poly(lactic acid) (PLA), which are seen as a desirable alternative to fossil-based polymers because they have less environmental impact. PLA is an aliphatic polyester, primarily produced by industrial polycondensation of lactic acid and/or ring-opening polymerization of lactide. Melt processing is the main technique used for mass production of PLA products for the medical, textile, plasticulture, and packaging industries. To fulfill additional desirable product properties and extend product use, PLA has been blended with other resins or compounded with different fillers such as fibers, and micro- and nanoparticles. This paper presents a review of the current status of PLA mass production, processing techniques and current applications, and also covers the methods to tailor PLA properties, the main PLA degradation reactions, PLA products' end-of-life scenarios and the environmental footprint of this unique polymer.},

Three different recycled thermoplastics, namely acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), and high impact polystyrene (HIPS) (with different Young's modulus, glass transition temperature, rheological properties), have been selected (as a case study) for multi-material AM. The functional prototypes have been printed on fused deposition modelling (FDM) setup as tensile specimens (as per ASTM D638 type-IV standard) with different combinations of top, middle, and bottom layers (of ABS/PLA/HIPS), at different printing speed and infill percentage density. The specimens were subjected to thermal (glass transition temperature and heat capacity) and mechanical testing (peak load, peak strength, peak elongation, percentage elongation at peak, and Young's modulus) to ascertain their suitability in load-bearing structures, and the fabrication of functional prototypes of mechanical meta-materials. The results have been supported by photomicrographs to observe the microstructure of the analyzed multi-materials.},

To see how fast Baltic companies are adapting to digitalization trend and, therefore, how good they are at keeping or improving their competitive advantage, we have developed a digital maturity assessment methodology, which was applied to the listed enterprises in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This methodology allowed us to detect certain digital maturity trends, such as the significant growth of the attention paid towards concepts related to ‘process automation'. Further, it was clear that many companies are concerned with online business, which can be well-seen from the analyzed annual reports. Additionally, we have compared the level and dynamics of the company's digital maturity to its financial and market performance. We have concluded that, although there is a positive relationship between several financial indicators (e.g., sales growth), it is too early to see the positive effect of digital maturity on a company's stock performance.},

abstract = {One of the major limitations in polymer recycling is their sorting as they are collected in mixes. The majority of polymers are highly incompatible without compatibilizers. For sorting of polymers, high-speed online Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is nowadays relatively widespread. It is however limited by the use of carbon black as a pigment and UV-stabilizer, which strongly absorbs near-infrared signals. Mid-Infrared (MIR) hyperspectral cameras were recently put on the market. However, their wavelength ranges are smaller and their resolutions are poorer, in comparison with laboratory equipment based on Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR). The identification of specific signals of end-of-life polymers for recycling purposes is becoming an important stake since they are very diverse, highly formulated, and more and more used in copolymers and blends, leading to complex waste stocks mainly as WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment). Dark colored plastics are the major part of WEEE, which also contains mainly styrenics (ABS, HIPS and their blends). In addition, styrenics are especially concerned by the need of identification. In this framework, spectral characterizations of ten types of polymers were scrutinized through about eighty pristine and real waste samples. Polymer characteristic signals were aggregated in charts to help rapid and automatized distinction through specific signals, even in limited resolution and frequency ranges.},

Since absorptive capacity reflects an organization's ability to extract innovative ideas from its environment, it plays a critical role in fostering intrapreneurship and innovative performance within existing firms. In this paper, we adopt micro-foundations perspective and study how goal orientations of employees affect their individual-level absorptive capacity, which would in turn shape collective innovative performance. Furthermore, we examine conditions under which individuals' absorptive capacities can efficiently aggregate and leads to increased collective innovation performance. We tested our theoretical model using an original dataset collected from 648 knowledge workers from 126 functional areas. Our analysis show that individuals' learning and prove orientation are important predictors of their absorptive capacity, and that individuals' aggregate absorptive capacity would lead to positive innovation outcomes especially when their activities are highly coordinated.},

abstract = {Cleaner production and sustainability are of crucial importance in the field of manufacturing processes where great amounts of energy and materials are being consumed. Nowadays, additive manufacturing technologies such as direct additive laser manufacturing allow us to manufacture functional products with high added value. Insofar as environmental considerations become an important issue in our society, as well as legislation regarding environment become prominent (Normalization ISO 14 044), the environmental impact of those processes have to be evaluated in order to make easier its acceptance in the industrial world. Some studies have been conducted on electric consumption of machine tools (standby consumption, in process consumption, etc.) but only a few studies take into account the whole existing environmental flows (material, fluids, electricity). This paper presents a new methodology where all flows consumed (material, fluids, electricity) are considered in the environmental impact assessment. This method coupled a global view required in a sustainable approach and an accurate evaluation of flow consumption in the machine. The methodology developed is based on a predictive model of flow consumption defined from the manufacturing path and CAD model of the part which will be produce. In order to get an accurate model of the process, each feature of the machine is modeled. The goal of this work is to integrate this model into the design loop for additive manufacturing parts. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London 2013.},

An analysis of various DIY retail strategies and DIY decking companies was synthesised to provide insights into the DIY industry. Findings – The insights into the industry outlines the changing consumer attitudes and motivations towards DIY and decking tasks. The findings on an evolving DIY industry, in particular the decking market demonstrate useful implications for academics, policy makers and brand practitioners. Originality/value – There have been little industry studies that delve into specifically decking products. Considering the vast increase in homeware, renovations, and gardening, the study provides insights from various case studies into the strategies undertaken by Australian and global companies. In addition, the majority of studies undertaken have also been concerned with the intrinsic motivations of consumers and not necessarily the extrinsic effect that brands and retailers advertently and inadvertently communicate and signal to consumers of DIY products.},

abstract = {Although research on the adoption of lean manufacturing in the furniture industry in emerging economies is slowly progressing, its implementation has been emphasized by researchers and practitioners. Research on this scope is therefore limited, particularly when compared to the vast amount of scholarly studies contributed to successful implementation of lean in the developed countries. To support the narrow body of knowledge on this under-researched scope, this paper presents the current shortfalls of implementing the lean manufacturing in terms of motives, barriers, challenges, and applications. To address these issues, a methodological approach was implemented in two tiers. Firstly, a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art literature on the issues was performed followed by an analytic approach using a survey on 148 companies in Malaysia to finalize the research. Upon validation of the analyses, the results revealed that most of the lean companies agreed that the reasons for lean implementation are to increase efficiency, to clean up and organize the workplace, and to increase utilization of space. Non-lean companies believe that issues related to knowledge are the reasons for not undertaking lean implementation. However, lean companies believe that the obstacles are more about employee-related issues including lack of labor resources, lack of implementation know-how, and employee resistance to change. Lean companies also face challenges in the form of technical knowledge, training, and financial resources during the early phase of lean implementation. In addition, only three applications – 5S, employee training, and quality control – were found to be useable in the Malaysian wood and furniture industry. These findings present a critical view of the current shortfalls of lean implementation in the wood and furniture industry throughout Malaysia and other emerging economies.},

Examines the design considerations of a wind turbine including material properties, reinforcement techniques, integration of non-printed parts components, printed component design and print optimization.


Conclusions

The feasibility of printed components has been proved from a print time perspective.
There is potential for 3D printing small wind turbines but research is required to further qualigy and quantify this potential. The developed design serves as an effective platform for further design optimization and is particularly useful as an education and experimental tool.

HMA technique is presented with significant benefits of decreased print time and component cost.

Acetone vapor bath post processing treatment has been present with reduced surface stress concentrations resulting in improved toughness and strain characteristics.

It has found its applications in various areas, such as medicine (bioprinting), art, manufacturing and engineering. On the other hand, its use in separation membrane engineering is relatively new. The use of additive manufacturing techniques could provide more control towards the design of separation membrane systems and offers novel membrane preparation techniques that are able to produce membranes of different shapes, types and designs which cannot be made using conventional techniques such as phase inversion or sintering. Here we provide key background information on 3D printing technologies and applications in membrane engineering; a discussion of the potential and limitations of current 3D printing technologies for membrane engineering and future aspects of the technology. Due to the potential benefits of 3D printing in membrane manufacturing, in particular the unprecedented control over membrane architecture the technique could allow, the use of 3D printing in membrane systems should see significant growth in the near future.},

abstract = {In this work we have analysed the properties of blends of recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) filled with talc. We have used two kinds of polymer matrices. The first one came entirely from ground injection moulded parts whereas the second was bimodal, incorporating 80{\%} of the previous HDPE and 20{\%} of recycled HDPE coming from bottles. We have also used two kinds of commercial talc characterized by a medium particle size of 2 $\mu$m and 10 $\mu$m, respectively. The amount of talc added to both matrices weighed of 10{\%} and 20{\%}. With regards to the mechanical properties of the analysed composites, greater values of Young's modulus and break stresses were found using a smaller particle size and higher talc content. On the other hand, the combination of the two HDPEs with very different viscosities produced a notable increase in the strain at break and in the absorbed energy; both measured at high and low strain rates. Despite the differences in viscosities between the two HDPEs, we did not observe separation of phases during either the processing or testing. Under impact loading, the higher energy absorption in the composites was observed when the finest talc grade with a 10{\%} content weight was added to the bimodal matrix. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Nowadays, the smart city has crystallised into an image of a city permeated with top-down and centrally controlled technological infrastructures that promise to improve the urban environment in terms of efficiency, security and sustainability. However, many scholars have criticised this perception of networked technologies for not being able to meet the needs of city-dwellers, raising privacy issues, and leading to an increase of environmentally harmful consumption of ICTs. The aim of this article is to contribute to the ongoing dialogue by providing a taxonomy of the smart city, based on certain technology governance models. After theoretically discussing the socio-environmental costs of each model, I argue for a commons-oriented approach which could democratise the means of making and offer more environmental benefits.},

abstract = {Prototyping is interwoven with nearly all product, service, and systems development efforts. A prototype is a pre-production representation of some aspect of a concept or final design. Prototyping often predetermines a large portion of resource deployment in development and influences design project success. This review surveys literature sources in engineering, management, design science, and architecture. The study is focused around design prototyping for early stage design. Insights are synthesized from critical review of the literature: key objectives of prototyping, critical review of major techniques, relationships between techniques, and a strategy matrix to connect objectives to techniques. The review is supported with exemplar prototypes provided from industrial design efforts. Techniques are roughly categorized into those that improve the outcomes of prototyping directly, and those that enable prototyping through lowering of cost and time. Compact descriptions of each technique provide a foundation to compare the potential benefits and drawbacks of each. The review concludes with a summary of key observations, highlighted opportunities in the research, and a vision of the future of prototyping. This review aims to provide a resource for designers as well as set a trajectory for continuing innovation in the scientific research of design prototyping.},

abstract = {A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords: Circular economy Sustainable development Thematic mapping Multiple correspondence analysis Topic modeling Historiographic analysis A B S T R A C T Circular economy (CE) has gained momentum in the political, economic and scientific fields. The growing popularity of the concept is accompanied by some definitional ambiguities and conceptual uncertainties. In particular , the relationship and contribution of CE to sustainable development (SD) and thus to a more sustainable society is currently under discussion. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this discussion by providing new insights into the evolution and state of CE research over the past two decades, in general, and its sustainability connotation, in particular. For doing so, a mixed-methods approach was adopted that combines a longitudinal bibliographic network analysis, multiple correspondence analysis and k-means clustering, correlated topic modeling, historiographic citation analysis and a semantic content analysis. The results indicate that the CE literature body can be divided into management and technically-oriented studies that have either a beginning-of-life or an end-of-life focus. Recycling is the most referred to R-strategy, followed by re-manufacturing, repair and reuse, which, however, occur one order of magnitude less frequently. CE research and SD were found to exhibit a subset relationship, as only a limited number of environmental aspects is directly addressed. Social aspects form a periphery. The qualitative analysis further portraits the conceptual evolution of the CE-SD relationship between 2000 and 2019 by following the citation network of the 30 most influential CE papers. The results contribute to positioning CE research within the general Sustainable Development debate and to identifying potential, sustainability-related shortcomings and blind spots.},

The global community of makerspaces has evolved quickly and in turn, substantial hype is attributed to its potential for radical sustainable innovation. In this article, we explore this potential in the context of the new 'circular economy' agenda. We focus the research on the critical role of makerspace managers/founders who are recognised as gatekeepers to circular practices. The research method is action-led including expert interviews (academics and founders/managers) as well as two generative context-mapping workshops, run at selected makerspaces in collaboration with their founders/ managers. We unearth everyday 'how-to' guidance to interweave circular practices within makerspaces from the outset by: fostering an enabling culture; building local connections; nurturing individual/ community capacities; and stimulating practical know-how. However, while the research reveals immense opportunities to cultivate circular literacy from within makerspaces, the prospects to ask more profound questions about our economy, through makerspace practices, are found to be compromised by day-today concerns. The insights from this research can act as a starting point for future work in this emerging research area.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is a versatile method to produce scaffolds for tissue engineering. In 3DP the solid is created by the reaction of a liquid selectively sprayed onto a powder bed. Despite the importance of the powder properties, there has to date been a relatively poor understanding of the relation between the powder properties and the printing outcome. This article aims at improving this understanding by looking at the link between key powder parameters (particle size, flowability, roughness, wettability) and printing accuracy. These powder parameters are determined as key factors with a predictive value for the final 3DP outcome. Promising results can be expected for mean particle size in the range of 20-35 ??m, compaction rate in the range of 1.3-1.4, flowability in the range of 5-7 and powder bed surface roughness of 10-25 ??m. Finally, possible steps and strategies in pushing the physical limits concerning improved quality in 3DP are addressed and discussed. ?? 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Metallurgy is a key enabler of a circular economy (CE), its digitalization is the metallurgical Internet of Things (m-IoT). In short: Metallurgy is at the heart of a CE, as metals all have strong intrinsic recycling potentials. Process metallurgy, as a key enabler for a CE, will help much to deliver its goals. The first-principles models of process engineering help quantify the resource efficiency (RE) of the CE system, connecting all stakeholders via digitalization. This provides well-argued and first-principles environmental information to empower a tax paying consumer society, policy, legislators, and environmentalists. It provides the details of capital expenditure and operational expenditure estimates. Through this path, the opportunities and limits of a CE, recycling, and its technology can be estimated. The true boundaries of sustainability can be determined in addition to the techno-economic evaluation of RE. The integration of metallurgical reactor technology and systems digitally, not only on one site but linking different sites globally via hardware, is the basis for describing CE systems as dynamic feedback control loops, i.e., the m-IoT. It is the linkage of the global carrier metallurgical processing system infrastructure that maximizes the recovery of all minor and technology elements in its associated refining metallurgical infrastructure. This will be illustrated through the following: (1) System optimization models for multimetal metallurgical processing. These map large-scale m-IoT systems linked to computer-aided design tools of the original equipment manufacturers and then establish a recycling index through the quantification of RE. (2) Reactor optimization and industrial system solutions to realize the “CE (within a) Corporation—CEC,” realizing the CE of society. (3) Real-time measurement of ore and scrap properties in intelligent plant structures, linked to the modeling, simulation, and optimization of industrial extractive process metallurgical reactors and plants for both primary and secondary materials processing. (4) Big-data analysis and process control of industrial metallurgical systems, processes, and reactors by the application of, among others, artificial intelligence techniques and computer-aided engineering. (5) Minerals processing and process metallurgical theory, technology, simulation, and analytical tools, which are all key enablers of the CE. (6) Visualizing the results of all the tools used for estimating the RE of the CE system in a form that the consumer and general public can understand. (7) The smart integration of tools and methods that quantify RE and deliver sustainable solutions, named in this article as circular economy engineering. In view of space limitations, this message will be colored in by various publications also with students and colleagues, referring to (often commercial) software that acts as a conduit to capture and formalize the research of the large body of work in the literature by distinguished metallurgical engineers and researchers and realized in innovative industrial solutions. The author stands humbly on the shoulders of these developments and their distinguished developers.

abstract = {The teaching of anatomy has consistently been the subject of societal controversy, especially in the context of employing cadaveric materials in professional medical and allied health professional training. The reduction in dissection-based teaching in medical and allied health professional training programs has been in part due to the financial considerations involved in maintaining bequest programs, accessing human cadavers and concerns with health and safety considerations for students and staff exposed to formalin-containing embalming fluids. This report details how additive manufacturing or three-dimensional (3D) printing allows the creation of reproductions of prosected human cadaver and other anatomical specimens that obviates many of the above issues. These 3D prints are high resolution, accurate color reproductions of prosections based on data acquired by surface scanning or CT imaging. The application of 3D printing to produce models of negative spaces, contrast CT radiographic data using segmentation software is illustrated. The accuracy of printed specimens is compared with original specimens. This alternative approach to producing anatomically accurate reproductions offers many advantages over plastination as it allows rapid production of multiple copies of any dissected specimen, at any size scale and should be suitable for any teaching facility in any country, thereby avoiding some of the cultural and ethical issues associated with cadaver specimens either in an embalmed or plastinated form.

abstract = {Continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTPCs) are becoming more significant in industrial applications due to their inherit advantages such as excellent mechanical performance, potential use in lightweight structures and being recyclable. Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a promising additive manufacturing technology and an alternative to conventional processes for the fabrication of CFRTPCs due to its ability to build functional parts having complex geometries. However, a major concern affecting the efficient use of 3D printed composites is their weak interlaminar bonding performance compared to conventional pre-preg composites. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of layer thickness and fibre volume content on the interlaminar bonding performance of 3D printed continuous carbon, glass and Kevlar{\textregistered}fibre reinforced nylon composites manufactured by FDM technique. Short beam shear tests were carried out to determine interlaminar shear strength (ILSS). SEM images and cross-sectional micrographs were examined to assess failure mechanics of the different configurations. It was observed that the effect of layer thickness of nylon samples on the interlaminar shear performance was marginally significance. ILSS values decrease as layer thickness increase due to higher porosity. In addition, continuous fibre reinforced samples show higher ILSS values than unreinforced ones but, conversely, the level of increase in ILSS is moderate with continued increase in fibre content, particularly in the case of Kevlar{\textregistered}fibre. Carbon fibre reinforced composites exhibit the best interlaminar shear performance with higher stiffness. On the other hand, Kevlar{\textregistered}fibre reinforced composites have the lowest interlaminar shear performance due to poor wettability of Kevlar{\textregistered}fibre bundles by the nylon, leading to extensive delamination. Finally, the results obtained demonstrate that it is still a challenge to increase shear performance of 3D printed composites with respect to common pre-preg materials. Nevertheless, ILSS values exhibited by 3D printed composites are significantly higher than the usual 3D printed thermoplastics.},

abstract = {The practice of collecting, treating, and managing solid waste prior to disposal has become a necessity in developing and modern societies. However, over the years, most waste has become regarded as having second-rate value and could be recovered and reused for valuable goods. However, the construction costs for conventional Material Recovery Facility(s) (MRFs) have been a major barrier for its implementation, and these technologies also require considerable technical expertise, which is not often available in developing nations for the successful operation of the MRFs. Covenant University, a private mission institution undertaking a waste-to-wealth scheme, is focused on managing and processing used materials to create reusable products. Such materials included PET bottles, paper waste, food waste from cafeterias, plastic food packs, nylon, tin cans, and others. Specific areas from the university which were chosen for the survey included the residential areas for staff and students and the two cafeterias. The waste generated was characterized so as to quantify the amount of recyclable waste generated, and also to find out which was most-occurring. The survey involved the use of structured questionnaires, on-site observations, and measurements. The study revealed that the average amount of recyclable waste generated per day in the institution were 55.56{\%} food waste, 13.46{\%} PET bottles, 12.64{\%} other plastic, 9.63{\%} nylon, 4.68{\%} tin cans, and 4.03{\%} paper. The study establishes that adequate waste characterization is a requirement for effective integrated solid waste management, which would boost resource recovery, reuse, and recycling.},

abstract = {The recycling of plastics from Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) was constrained by the mix of types. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is suitable for polymer detection, and it is a rapid, non-destructive analysis method that can be applied to automatic on-line sorting system. The NIR spectra of four commonly recovered WEEE plastics, which are polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene/polycarbonate (ABS/PC) blend, was collected. The flame-retardant ABS showed difference from ABS in NIR spectra. Three classification methods, which are spectral angle mapper (SAM), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and linear discriminant analysis combined with principal component analysis (PCA-LDA), was tested. And the classification models trained on the virgin plastics have been compared with the models trained on the WEEE plastic to evaluate how these methods perform under limited training data. PLS-DA is one of the most widely used classification method in spectral data analysis, but it had unsuccessful prediction when the training set only included virgin plastics. But the overall prediction accuracy over 99{\%} could be achieved by the other two whether the training set was the spectra of virgin plastics or WEEE plastics. In general, NIR spectroscopy has the competency of separating WEEE plastics. Finally, an automatic on-line sorting system was designed specifically for the large plastic segments from household appliances and electronics.},

abstract = {This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of the potential of Social Innovation (SI) for social transformation. Being a popular concept, SI has been discussed for decades, increasingly recognized for its complexity.Asystematic review of the literature on SI was undertaken to understand the state-of-the-art, the evolution of the concept and its core underpinnings in order to meet the research aim of this paper. The literature is relatively broad in relation to general characteristics of SI and contexts where it is happening, but the use of the 'social innovation' term often reveals semantic problems, generating multiple, interchangeable and mixed understandings. In this paper, we identify and discuss two ways of using SI in the literature: (i) one that favours the materialization of SI, as something tangible that can be observed, measured and systematically analysed; we called this a cartesian approach; and (ii) another that uses systemic thinking focussing on successful factors of SI to enhance its transformative capacity in existing system(s) through change in routines, resources, and beliefs; we called this a disruptive approach. While still emerging in SI literature the academic discussion about SI dynamics and its transformative capacity is increasingly addressed by scholars. We conclude the paper by arguing that more transformative-driven and systemic SI may enhance its potential to lead change, while it only creates transformation when it scales-up or out, and when it has durability and transformative impact.},

abstract = {Grassroots innovation projects have the potential to generate novel, bottom-up solutions that respond to local situations, interests and values – solving the social, economic and environmental problems of marginalized communities; however, these projects can raise important challenges during their design, testing, development and implementation. Although extant studies identify some of these problems, the literature and practice lack a comprehensive diagnostic tool that can effectively predict the potential and success of grassroots initiatives. For this reason, important problems are often neglected, and failed projects are not thoroughly investigated and analyzed, which leads to missed opportunities of corrective learning. This study addresses this knowledge gap, proposing a diagnostic tool based on existing theoretical frameworks, which is then validated by investigating a failed grassroots innovation initiative, in order to identify its major shortcomings, and learn to avoid them in future projects. The findings also outline the role and importance of a socially inclusive approach for an effective deployment of grassroots initiatives, clarifying the relationship between grassroots innovation success and local community involvement.},

abstract = {To characterize potential air pollution issues related to recycling facilities of waste plastics, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from melted virgin and waste plastics pellets were analyzed. In this study, laboratory experiments were performed to melt virgin and waste plastic pellets under various temperatures (150, 200, and 250 °C) and atmospheres (air and nitrogen [N2]). In the study presented here, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and the recycled waste plastic pellets were used. The VOCs generated from each plastic pellets were collected by Tenax/Carboxen adsorbent tubes and analyzed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS). The result showed the higher temperatures generated larger amounts of total VOCs (TVOCs). The VOCs emitted from the virgin plastic pellets likely originated from polymer degradation. Smaller TVOC emissions were observed in N2 atmosphere than in air atmosphere. In particular, larger amounts of the oxygenated compounds, which are generally hazardous and malodorous, were detected in air than in N2. In addition to the compounds originating from polymer degradation, the compounds originating from the plastic additives were also detected from LDPE and PS. Furthermore, various species of VOCs likely originating from contaminant inseparate polyvinyl chloride (PVC), food residues, cleaning agents, degreasers, and so on were detected from the waste plastic. Thus, melting waste plastics, as is conducted in recycling facilities, might generate larger amounts of potentially toxic compounds than producing virgin plastics.

abstract = {Purpose: The advancement of technologies and their adoption affects the socio-economic growth of nations. This research is focused on how this innovation adoption path is linked to economic growth of nations since the previous IT revolution has been combined with existing industries and adding values in terms of applying intelligence through adopting digital technologies. Approach/Design/Methodology: There are two different approaches—process approach and factor approach—in innovation adoption research. Innovation diffusion research, which is one of the process approaches, is related to adoption, diffusion, and impact theories, but there are limitations in explaining the perspective of a nation other than individual and organization on the basis of previous literatures. Therefore, we build the integrative model to verify innovative growth path of nations by applying Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DoI) and Technology (T)-Organization (O)-Environment (E) framework, which can explain factors of affecting innovation. We evaluate eight hypotheses with data collected from 137 to 212 nations using international information index by credible organizations: World Economic Forum (WEF), World Bank, United Nations (UN), and International Communications Union (ITU), based on the integrative model we proposed. The path analysis using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is performed, and the result shows that the path from technological innovation capabilities (T), human capital (O), and environment (E) is related directly to economic impact, except for the path from human capital to value chain breadth directly and indirectly. The indirect path through Information and Communication Technology (ICT) access, use, and value chain helps to understand the full impact of digital innovation. Practical implications: By verifying this relationship, we expect to give suggestions in policy perspective and in building strategy towards innovative growth of countries. Our results show that technological innovation capabilities take time to show impact in terms of economic growth than the other factors, which are human capital, and political and regulatory environment of country. The nurture of human capital directly affects to the economic growth of nations relative to other T and E factors.

abstract = {Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) technologies such as Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) have made it possible to eliminate environmentally polluting supply chain activities in the tooling industry and to repair and remanufacture valuable tools and dies. In this article, we investigate three case studies to reveal the extent to which DMD-based manufacturing of molds and dies can currently achieve reduced environmental emissions and energy consumption relative to conventional manufacturing pathways. It is shown that DMD's greatest opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of tool and die manufacturing will come from its ability to enable remanufacturing. Laser-based remanufacturing of tooling is shown to reduce cost and environmental impact simultaneously, especially as the scale of the tool increases. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In a time of rapid climate change, understanding what may encourage sustainable consumer behaviour is a vital but difficult challenge. Using an attitude network approach, we investigated which associations people have towards conventional and bio-based plastic in order to develop an empirically-based approach to initiate attitude- and behaviour change. With a qualitative study (N = 97), we distilled 25 evaluative reactions (i.e. beliefs, emotions, and behaviours) that encompass people's attitudes towards using (bio-based) plastic. These reactions were used to create a new scale, which was subsequently tested among 508 online participants. The resulting data was then used to build a network displaying relationships between participants' evaluative reactions regarding plastic use. Analyses of this network indicated that guilt was most strongly connected to people's willingness to pay more for bio-based plastic products. Based on this, we conducted another study (N = 285) in which we experimentally manipulated guilt (general guilt, personal guilt, and control condition) to determine its effects on people's willingness to pay for a sustainable cause. Results indicate that manipulating guilt can lead participants to donate more to a sustainable cause. This effect was fully mediated by self-reported guilt. Determining which factors influence consumers to change their buying behaviour towards sustainability is the first step in creating a demand for more sustainable products amongst the public and investors.},

@article{Sneddon2006,
abstract = {Not yet two decades after the publication of Our Common Future, the world's political and environmental landscape has changed significantly. Nonetheless, we argue that the concept and practice of sustainable development (SD)-as guiding institutional principle, as concrete policy goal, and as focus of political struggle-remains salient in confronting the multiple challenges of this new global order. Yet how SD is conceptualized and practiced hinges crucially on: the willingness of scholars and practitioners to embrace a plurality of epistemological and normative perspectives on sustainability; the multiple interpretations and practices associated with the evolving concept of "development"; and efforts to open up a continuum of local-to-global public spaces to debate and enact a politics of sustainability. Embracing pluralism provides a way out of the ideological and epistemological straightjackets that deter more cohesive and politically effective interpretations of SD. Using pluralism as a starting point for the analysis and normative construction of sustainable development, we pay particular attention to how an amalgam of ideas from recent work in ecological economics, political ecology and the "development as freedom" literature might advance the SD debate beyond its post-Brundtland quagmire. Enhanced levels of ecological degradation, vast inequalities in economic opportunities both within and across societies, and a fractured set of institutional arrangements for global environmental governance all represent seemingly insurmountable obstacles to a move towards sustainability. While these obstacles are significant, we suggest how they might be overcome through a reinvigorated set of notions and practices associated with sustainable development, one that explicitly examines the linkages between sustainability policies and sustainability politics. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Abstract Humankind's next step into space will require long-term habitation and shelter on the lunar surface, which will only be possible if pressurized habitats are available. Buildings on Earth are designed to take advantage of the superior compressive properties of the building material. On the other hand, this luxury will not be available on the Moon because the internal pressure in the building will result in the entire structure being under tension. The use of in situ fabricated glass-fiber composite and the recently developing rapid-prototyping type technology will be useful in fabricating pressurized lunar habitats. Hence, the main objective of the designer will be to reduce the tensile stresses and bring them to manageable limits. This work is concerned with the study of design changes that will result in efficient habitats on the Moon. Designs are presented in this paper that would tend to reduce the tensile stresses and increase the compressive stresses, making it possible to build habitats that will be practical and safe. Proper design and appropriate materials would be the key to building the habitats on the lunar surface. Some ideas for the recycling of carrier moduli have also been presented to reduce possible junk on the lunar surface. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {Achieving sustainable manufacturing in enterprises in all three dimensions (economic, social, environmental) involves complex decision-making processes. New environmental regulations, requirements set by customers for sustainable products, and economic benefits through for example resource savings are drivers for enterprises to consider manufacturing from a sustainable perspective. To support decision makers in enterprises, decision-support systems can be used to analyze the production from a sustainable perspective and to create suggestions for optimization of products and processes. This literature review addresses decision-support systems for sustainable manufacturing and presents the most commonly used sustainable indicators and decision-making methods. The literature review is focused on research approach which consider all three dimensions of sustainability (economic, social, and environmental) and on decision support systems applied in the phases of the product and production life-cycle (product and production design, production planning, production, and remanufacturing of processes and products). The results of the review show, that current investigations of decision support systems are more focused on the integration of sustainability in all three dimensions (economic, environmental, and social) at the strategic planning level (design and remanufacturing of products and processes), which is not reflected well at the operational level (production planning and controlling), where decision-making is mostly driven by single sustainable dimensions (environmental and economic). In addition to economic and environmental objectives, sustainable production planning and controlling systems should also consider social planning objectives. Further research is required to identify which sustainable indicators can be considered in sustainable production planning and controlling systems.},

abstract = {“Internet + recycling”, a new and emerging collecting mode, is booming in conjunction with widespread Internet use in China. For the recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), this paper studies collaborative collection effort strategies in a collection system consisting of a third-party and an e-tailer based on the “Internet + recycling” business model. Considering the collaboration occurring during collecting and selling and mutual influences of partners on the recycling of old products, the paper applies collection effort cost sharing mechanisms to promote recycling. Four models, namely, the centralized model (C-Model), unit transfer price model (P-Model), unilateral cost sharing model (U-Model) and bilateral cost sharing model (B-Model), are established, and optimal decisions and members' profits in various collaborative models are derived and compared. The results show that there exists an interval of profit sharing proportions in which each of the two cost sharing models is a Pareto improvement of the P-Model, and the total collection volume and profit of the collecting system increase in the B-Model relative to those in the U-Model under the same proportion of profit sharing. However, the B-Model is not necessarily a Pareto improvement of the U-Model. The results also show that profit improvements of both parties can be achieved without the third-party sharing the e-tailer's collection effort cost in the B-Model when the collaborative marginal profit is large enough. The paper further explores the impact of the collaborative marginal profit and third-party's market influence on the total collection volume and the efficiency of the collecting system. This study provides insight into the promotion of WEEE recycling and into the selection of collaborative strategies for Internet recycling enterprises. The work will prove beneficial to the development of the WEEE “Internet + recycling” industry.},

abstract = {The era of affordable 3D printing is clearly underway; indeed, the historical patterns of growth in 3D printing are, in many ways, strikingly similar to those associated with the growth of home computing in the late 1970's. One of the prominent areas of increased interest in 3D printing is in the realm of education: fabrication tools are becoming available to college undergraduates and high school students, and even to younger children. Accompanying this burgeoning growth, however, there is an acute need to consider the ways in which 3D printing should develop, as a technology, in order to accommodate the abilities and activities of youngsters. This paper discusses a number of technological challenges to be overcome in making 3D printing truly available to children over the next decade. The most prominent challenges described here include: (a) expanding the range of physical media available for printing, (b)incorporating ideas derived from pick-and-place mechanisms into 3D printing; (c) exploring methods for creating portable and ubiquitous printing devices; (d) creating tools for hand-customization and finishing of tangible printed objects and (e) devising software techniques for specifying; altering; and combining 3D elements in the context of printing. By facing these challenges; we can provide children (and adults) with a remarkably powerful and expressive means for creating all sorts of personalized, artifacts.},

abstract = {Open source software and open innovation are an important resource for today's industries. Communities collaboratively create different kind of publicly available value, boosting innovation and also technology. However, whereas this value is generated and captured by various involved parties, the outcomes are, in many cases, commercialized by companies who build their business models on this openness. Thus, current business model representations used for these open systems mainly focus on the commercial side of companies, not directly regarding the value creation and distribution by the underlying communities. This results in a lack of potential representation of alternative value created by individuals and communities that are not necessarily aiming for direct monetary compensation. In this work, we show, by the example of open source projects, how communities create value and their potential to be represented by the upcoming domain of new business models. The emerging idea of new business models, based on sharing, collaboration, and the circular economy, not only considers economical viewpoints, but also social and ecological. New trends in research are intensively starting to investigate these models and how they can be brought to practice. The co-creation of value, collaboration of various actors, and following a shared vision are just some of the identified overlaps that are also essential for a potential representation of open communities. This first review unveils that new business models and open source software projects have a variety of aspects in common. We highlight the potential of open communities to be seen as new business models themselves, instead of just being a pure enabler for firms' business models. This approach is leaving room to explore new organizational and economical aspects of open ecosystems, enhancing the understanding of co-creative communities and the definition of collaborative value.},

abstract = {This review presents a comprehensive description of the current pathways for recycling of polymers, via both mechanical and chemical recycling. The principles of these recycling pathways are framed against current-day industrial reality, by discussing predominant industrial technologies, design strategies and recycling examples of specific waste streams. Starting with an overview on types of solid plastic waste (SPW) and their origins, the manuscript continues with a discussion on the different valorisation options for SPW. The section on mechanical recycling contains an overview of current sorting technologies, specific challenges for mechanical recycling such as thermo-mechanical or lifetime degradation and the immiscibility of polymer blends. It also includes some industrial examples such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recycling, and SPW from post-consumer packaging, end-of-life vehicles or electr(on)ic devices. A separate section is dedicated to the relationship between design and recycling, emphasizing the role of concepts such as Design from Recycling. The section on chemical recycling collects a state-of-the-art on techniques such as chemolysis, pyrolysis, fluid catalytic cracking, hydrogen techniques and gasification. Additionally, this review discusses the main challenges (and some potential remedies) to these recycling strategies and ground them in the relevant polymer science, thus providing an academic angle as well as an applied one.},

abstract = {Reversible covalent chemistry provides access to robust materials with the ability to be degraded and reformed upon exposure to an appropriate stimulus. Photoresponsive units are attractive for this purpose, as the spatial and temporal application of light is easily controlled. Coumarin derivatives undergo a [2 + 2] cycloaddition upon exposure to long-wave UV irradiation (365 nm), and this process can be reversed using short-wave UV light (254 nm). Therefore, polymers cross-linked by coumarin groups are excellent candidates as reversible covalent gels. In this work, copolymerization of coumarin-containing monomers with the hydrophilic comonomer N,N-dimethylacrylamide yielded water-soluble, linear polymers that could be cured with long-wave UV light into free-standing hydrogels, even in the absence of a photoinitiator. Importantly, the gels were reverted back to soluble copolymers upon short-wave UV irradiation. This process could be cycled, allowing for recycling and remolding of the hydrogel into additio...},

abstract = {PVC is a universal polymer which can be processed into a wide variety of short-life or long-life products. As a result of increasing consumption of PVC-made products in recent years, the quantity of used PVC items entering the waste stream is gradually increased. Currently, there is a considerable public concern about the problem of plastic wastes, from which PVC has not escaped and the material or energy recycling may be a suitable way to overcome this problem. This review considers the various aspects of the PVC recycling such as recycling methods of PVC, special problems about some proposed processes, separation techniques, and recycling of mixed PVC wastes. In addition, an attempt is made to portray the current status of PVC recycling, the most recent technologies of recycling, and some recent scientific research in the field. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {There is a new Do-It-Yourself (DIY) paradigm that involves ordinary people inventing, designing, making, and/or selling physical goods ranging from jewellery to off-road vehicles. Via websites, this DIY involves combining the read-write functionality of Web 2.0 with computer-aided (CAD) design and additive manufacturing. In addition, the new DIY is carried out at workshops where people use handheld tools together with CAD and manufacturing machines. There have been two earlier waves of DIY: subsistence DIY (First Wave) and industrial DIY (Second Wave). It has been claimed that the new, Third Wave, DIY paradigm is revolutionary for prosumption, for innovation, and for entrepreneurship. Furthermore, it has been claimed that Third Wave DIY could be carried out by anybody at any location. However, much Third Wave DIY involves participants who are literate in a "lingua franca", and have computer skills. Furthermore, Third Wave DIY is often reliant on infrastructure used in industrialized manufacturing. Findings are reported from a study investigating the potential for Third Wave DIY to better enable prosumption, innovation, and entrepreneurship - particularly by local populations that lack functional literacy in any "lingua franca", computer skills, and access to industrial manufacturing infrastructure. Study findings suggest that while Third Wave DIY is revolutionary, its expansion may never be fully viable without subsidy of innovation activities. However, in many parts of the world, prosumption of basic goods may be more important initially than innovation of new sophisticated goods. This can be enabled by combining Third Wave DIY technologies with mobile production facilities. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Mani2014,
abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has the potential to create geometrically complex parts that require a high degree of customization, using less material and producing less waste. Recent studies have shown that AM can be an economically viable option for use by the industry, yet there are some inherent challenges associated with AM for wider acceptance. The lack of standards in AM impedes its use for parts production since industries primarily depend on established standards in processes and material selection to ensure the consistency and quality. Inability to compare AM performance against traditional manufacturing methods can be a barrier for implementing AM processes. AM process sustainability has become a driver due to growing environmental concerns for manufacturing. This has reinforced the importance to understand and characterize AM processes for sustainability. Process characterization for sustainability will help close the gaps for comparing AM performance to traditional manufacturing methods. Based on a literature review, this paper first examines the potential environmental impacts of AM. A methodology for sustainability characterization of AM is then proposed to serve as a resource for the community to benchmark AM processes for sustainability. Next, research perspectives are discussed along with relevant standardization efforts.},

A substantial portion of the existing research focuses on designing new sets of heuristics, demonstrating the interest in heuristics that might identify specific usability problems for specific application domains. This article presents an exhaustive review of 73 studies related to usability heuristics for specific domains and methodologies; the objective is to identify the approach that is used to create usability heuristics and whether a formal and systematic process is involved. We conducted a systematic literature review of papers published between 2006 and 2016. The review was based on the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham (2007) [13] and shows that most studies use an informal process to develop usability heuristics. The creation of heuristics is mainly based on existing heuristics, literature reviews, usability problems, and guidelines. However, a few studies apply a methodology to define, validate and refine the set of heuristics proposed. Nevertheless, these methodologies should be formalized in order to help the process of creating usability heuristics.},

abstract = {Various frameworks have been developed to guide organisations in embedding circular economy principles in their strategy and operational practice. However, there is a lack of studies analysing practical implementation of circular economy thinking in the higher education sector. Higher education institutions are strategic agents in supporting sustainable development through teaching, research and social outreach activities. They also represent a source of environmental impacts due to significant resource consumption and waste generation. This paper presents the first comprehensive study showing how higher education institutions can use an action-led step-by-step approach to build a business case and implement circular economy thinking in practice. The University of Manchester is used as an illustrative example of a large higher education institution. First, a background analysis and semi-structured interviews were carried out to determine the scope of the university's current sustainability policies and the ability of the management systems to respond to circular economy challenges. This was followed by stakeholder workshops to identify gaps and opportunities for building a business case for implementation of a circular economy. Finally, a critical assessment of the outcomes was carried out to identify further research needs for implementation of a circular economy in higher education institutions. Although focused on the higher education sector, the proposed action-led approach can be used by any organisation in the service sector looking to build more circular and sustainable business models.},

Using indicators designed to measure a 'safe and just' development space, we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs, and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2-6 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships. Strategies to improve physical and social provisioning systems, with a focus on sufficiency and equity, have the potential to move nations towards sustainability, but the challenge remains substantial.},

abstract = {Agricultural waste can be recycled in different ways. Cost-effectiveness is important information for investment decision-making of enterprises and policy-making of government to choose a profitable way to recycle agricultural waste. Therefore, this paper aims to present a cost-benefit analysis to assess and compare the cost-effectiveness between feasible recycling methods, and further propose cost-effective ways for recycling agricultural waste in Taiwan. Three recycling types of agricultural wastes, namely, composting, biogas power generation and biomass fuel are selected for cost-benefit analysis based on related regulations and policy supports of agricultural waste management in Taiwan. Primary data collected by sampling surveys conducted in 2018 supplemented by secondary data from national statistics are used for this study. Study results show that all three recycling types of agricultural wastes discussed in this study are profitable under corresponding economic conditions in 2018 with benefit/cost ratio greater than 1 and positive net present value; as expected, the cost-effectiveness of agricultural waste recycling varies depending on the recycling types, composition of input materials, and economic scales. Mixing chicken manure with other agricultural wastes for composting and using rice straw to make biomass fuel rods are estimated to have higher cost-effectiveness; livestock farms with small farming scale have relatively low biogas energy recovery efficiency; the cost-effectiveness of biogas power generation highly depends on fixed-in tariffs (FITs). Results imply that policy support for establishing co-processing centers of agricultural waste and differentiated FITs would be good measures to stimulate recycling efficiency of agricultural waste in Taiwan.},

abstract = {Objectives Additive manufacturing, which is more colloquially referred to as 3D printing, is quickly approaching mainstream adoption as a highly flexible processing technique that can be applied to plastic, metal, ceramic, concrete and other building materials. However, taking advantage of the tremendous versatility associated with in situ photopolymerization as well as the ability to select from a variety of preformed processible polymers, 3D printing predominantly targets the production of polymeric parts and models. The goal of this review is to connect the various additive manufacturing techniques with the monomeric and polymeric materials they use while highlighting emerging material-based developments. Methods Modern additive manufacturing technology was introduced approximately three decades ago but this review compiles recent peer-reviewed literature reports to demonstrate the evolution underway with respect to the various building techniques that differ significantly in approach as well as the new variations in polymer-based materials being employed. Results Recent growth of 3D printing has been dramatic and the ability of the various platform technologies to expand from rapid production prototypic models to the greater volume of readily customizable production of working parts is critical for continued high growth rates. This transition to working part production is highly dependent on adapting materials that deliver not only the requisite design accuracy but also the physical and mechanical properties necessary for the application. Significance With the weighty distinction of being called the next industrial revolution, 3D printing technologies is already altering many industrial and academic operations including changing models for future healthcare delivery in medicine and dentistry.},

Others' perceptions of one's networking skills shape success, but little is known about the factors that drive these perceptions. In the present research, we theorize that the ability to establish and maintain flow during conversations uniquely predicts individuals' networking success above and beyond other factors, such as extraversion, attractiveness, or interestingness. Consistent with this idea, Study 1 showed that individuals' ability to maintain conversational flow during live, synchronous conversations is positively associated with networking success during a speed-networking event, even after factoring in other potential predictors. In Study 2, participants reported on their existing networks, indicating that strong networkers are better at maintaining conversational flow than weak networkers. In Studies 3a-3b, we manipulated conversational flow and demonstrated that participants attribute stronger networking skills and are more eager to connect with a target who maintains high (versus low) levels of conversational flow.},

abstract = {Environmental degradation and biodiversity loss are worldwide problems caused by human activities, which can often be classified as a resource dilemma. Across two studies, and using self-determination theory as a framework, we examine the relationships between motivation, goals, sanctioning systems and sustainable behaviour in a resource dilemma. The resource dilemma used was a 2-person partnered design where each participant was required to make decisions about recreational fishing harvests in a small, private lake with a simulated partner. Study 1 used mediational analysis to demonstrate that quality of motivation affects goal content, and goal content predicts sustainable behaviour. Study 2 introduced a centralized sanctioning system to the resource dilemma, and found that this type of sanctioning system increased sustainable behaviour in the resource dilemma when added, and decreased sustainable behaviour when removed, concomitantly affecting the quality of participant motivation and goal content. The results expand upon self-determination theory, and point to the importance of distinguishing motivation from goals, examining quality of motivation through degree of internalization, and how these constructs as well as sustainable behaviour can be affected by a centralized sanction system.},

The circular economy {\{}(CE){\}} is a simple, but convincing, strategy, which aims at reducing both input of virgin materials and output of wastes by closing economic and ecological loops of resource flows. This article applies a sociometabolic approach to assess the circularity of global material flows.

Second, socioeconomic stocks are still growing at a high rate with net additions to stocks of {\{}17{\~{}}Gt/yr.{\}} Despite having considerably higher end-of-life recycling rates in the {\{}EU,{\}} the overall degree of circularity is low for similar reasons.

abstract = {Sharing economy has gained momentum in recent years. In this paper, a concept and a synthesised conceptual framework are developed for Sharing Economy-based Service Triad (SEST). Service triads have increasingly become an interesting topic in supply chain management literature. The study adopts a systematic literature review method carrying out content analysis of 100 peer-reviewed journal article focused on triad and sharing economy in order to propose a concept and develop a conceptual development of SEST. Case examples identified from secondary sources are used to illustrate the model. Based on the literature review and case example, the research first coins the term ‘Sharing Economy–based Service Triad' (SEST) by differentiating it from traditional manufacturing triads and manufacturing service triads. Then, building on social-capital and balance theories, the study develops a conceptual framework, which proposes two types of strategy for sharing-economy platforms (commitment- and control based platform strategies). These strategies reveal five service-triad structures/archetypes, which lead to different outcomes (e.g., service quality and social capital), which eventually lead to triple bottom line performance and avoid negative externalities. Finally, the study argues that SEST should not only follow economic logic, i.e., economic benefits but also adopt a social and environmental sustainability logic given the negative externalities.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

As the sustainable waste management, HSW recycling is an urgent requirement in China and other countries. However, public awareness of HSW recycling and its influencing factors were seldom systematically analyzed in China. In present study, an on-site face-to-face questionnaire survey was the main research tool. We investigate public awareness of HSW recycling in typical Chinese cities, including public behavior, recycling knowledge, and public willingness to participate. The factors influencing public awareness were also explored. We found that public awareness was inadequate regarding HSW treatment behavior and recycling knowledge. Age is the most important sociodemographic factor influencing the public awareness of HSW recycling. White collar, residents with higher educational attainment, and those aged 20–50 years displayed less environmentally responsible behavior with regard to HSW treatment. Manual workers, those with lower educational attainment, those with higher monthly income, and older people tend to have poorer HSW recycling knowledge. White collar workers, those with higher educational attainment, and those with lower monthly income were less willing to participate in HSW recycling. Accordingly, measurements conducted amongst specific demographic categories are proposed to improve public awareness of HSW recycling. The scientific information provided by this study may contribute to HSW recycling especially from a public awareness perspective.},

The environment not only provides amenity values, in addition to being a resource base and a sink for economic activities, it is also a fundamental life-support system. Environmental economists have suggested that, taking these four functions as an analytical starting point, unpriced or underpriced services should be internalised in the economy. In Europe significant advances have been achieved in the pricing of externalities by means of truly interdisciplinary analysis which accounts in detail for the environmental consequences. The monetary estimates reached as a result of such interdisciplinary research are gradually being applied to the economic analysis of environmental policy priorities. Although such figures provide only a partial and incomplete picture of the environmental costs at stake, they support and inform the analysis of the virtues of a circular economy for individual resources as well as for sustainability as a future trajectory.},

abstract = {Principles and practices of open science at universities are evolving. Increasing use and application of digital technologies and platforms in research and innovation are pushing universities to take up and develop new visions and principles for how research and innovation are performed. These open science policies and practices (i.e. open data sharing, open access publishing, open repositories, open physical labs, participatory design, and transdisciplinary research platforms) are expanding the ethos of science and innovation at universities. These new principles and practices of open science at universities are also triggering novel open innovation practices by university research teams. Open science and innovation practices hold great potential for accelerating the learning and creation of new knowledge, speeding up the research and innovation process for finding solutions for grand societal challenges, and nurturing the growth of highly innovative and entrepreneurial people. The purpose of this study was to identify emergent principles, practices, and underlying mechanisms of open science and innovation developed and encountered by research teams at universities. The results of this study provide directions for how to advance openness in science at universities and illustrate how openness in innovation is being remodelled by open science practices. Based on our findings, we propose an open exploration policy and a governance model of open science and innovation at universities in the digital world, which aspire to create increased societal value.},

abstract = {Living labs and innovation labs share many common traits and characteristics. Both con- cepts are linked to the public sector, and both concepts can be regarded as coping mech- anisms to deal with contemporary changes in the innovation landscape and within society as a whole. Both build on past initiatives and practices, but are also struggling to find their own clear identity and “raison d'{\^{e}}tre”. Because both concepts are largely prac- tice-driven, their theoretical underpinnings and foundations are mostly established after the fact: making sense of current practice rather than carefully researching and planning the further development. However, despite their similarities and common ground, most researchers treat living labs and innovation labs as separate literature streams. Here, start- ing from a review of the current issues and challenges with innovation in the public sec- tor, we look for links between both concepts by analyzing the current definitions, the predecessors, and the “state of the art” in terms of empirical research. Based on these findings, we summarize a set of similarities and differences between both concepts and propose a model towards more collaboration, mutual exchange, and integration of prac- tices between innovation labs, which can be regarded as initiators of innovation, and liv- ing labs, which can be regarded as executors of innovation. Thus, we add to the conceptual development of both concepts and propose a roadmap for the further integra- tion of both the theory and practice of living labs and innovation labs.},

abstract = {General guidelines for conducting literature reviews often do not address the question of literature searches and dealing with a potentially large number of identified sources. These issues are specifically addressed by so-called systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that propose a strict protocol for the search and appraisal of literature. Moreover, SLRs are claimed to be a 'standardized method' for literature reviews that is replicable, transparent, objective, unbiased and rigorous, and thus superior to other approaches for conducting literature reviews. These are significant and consequential claims that - despite increasing adoption of SLRs - remained largely unnoticed in the information systems (IS) literature. The objective of this debate is to draw attention of the IS community to SLR's claims, to question their justification and reveal potential risks of their adoption. This is achieved by first examining the origins of SLR and the prescribed SLR process and then by critically assessing their claims and implications. In this debate, we show that SLRs are applicable and useful for a very specific kind of literature review, a meta study that identifies and summarizes evidence from earlier research. We also demonstrate that the claims that SLRs provide superior quality are not justified. More importantly, we argue that SLR as a general approach to conducting literature reviews is highly questionable, concealing significant perils. The paper cautions that SLR could undermine critical engagement with literature and what it means to be scholarly in academic work.},

The versatility and effectiveness of prototypes paired with the ambiguous nature of developing a prototype can lead to wasted resources. Recent studies support this claim, demonstrating that under certain circumstances, designers often prototype without a clear purpose, building prototypes as a function of the design process rather than as a function of the design. These findings motivated the creation of the Prototyping Canvas, a tool to aid designers in planning for purposeful prototypes by identifying critical assumptions and questions to guide development. Business and engineering design literature influenced the development of the canvas, which was first tested with a client project in the SUTD-MIT International Design Centre (IDC). The feedback and insights from the design team guided revisions to the canvas. The updated canvas was then validated with 55 professionals during a design project sprint. The purpose of this paper is to present the Prototyping Canvas as a valid and effective design tool.},

In this study, an evaluation of optimum conditions for some cleaning parameters by using characterization results of effluents was accomplished. Although, a complete evaluation of process parameters has not been possible, good correlations between cleaner performance and effluent parameter measurements were achieved. The environmental pollution promoted through cleaning of plastics during the recycling process of polyolefins and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was investigated. A comparative evaluation with government requirements showed that these effluents should be treated at their source before discharge to the domestic sewage.

abstract = {Reclaimed materials such as waste plastics can be utilized in additive manufacturing to improve the self-reliance of warfighters on forward operating bases by cutting costs and decreasing the demand for the frequent resupplying of parts by the supply chain. In addition, the use of waste materials in additive manufacturing in the private sector would reduce cost and increase sustainability, providing a high-value output for used plastics. Experimentation is conducted to process polyethylene terephthalate bottles and packaging into filament that can then be used for additive manufacturing methods like fused filament fabrication, without the use of additives or modification to the polymer. The chemistry of different polyethylene terephthalate recycled feedstocks was evaluated and found to be identical, and thus mixed feedstock processing is a suitable approach. Rheological data showed drying of the recycled polyethylene terephthalate led to an increase in the polymer's viscosity. Thermal and mechanical properties were evaluated for filament with different processing conditions, as well as printed and molded specimens. Crystallinity ranged from 12.2 for the water cooled filament, compared to 24.9{\%} for the filament without any active cooling. Tensile results show that the elongation to failure was similar to an injection molded part (3.5{\%}) and tensile strength of 35.1 ± 8 MPa was comparable to commercial polycarbonate-ABS filament, demonstrating the robustness of the material. In addition, three point bending tests showed a similar load at failure for a select long-lead military part printed from the recycled filament compared to parts printed from commercial filament. Thus filament from recycled polyethylene terephthalate has the capability for replacing commercial filament in printing a diverse range of plastic parts.},

Although the technology for fully realizing the proposed concept is not entirely available, we have demonstrated a first case: Given the task of locomotion, various robots with different mechanics and control are evolved automatically. The design space is comprised of only linear actuators and sigmoidal control neurons embodied in an arbitrary thermoplastic body. The robots then print pre-assembled using rapid prototyping technology, and perform the task in reality. The robots are then recycled.

The main goal of this study is to develop a set of new polymeric blends with innovative properties, suitable for using in 3-D printing of prosthetic limbs using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology. Sustainable acting is achieved by reusing polymeric material left over from Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) processes for making raw material for FDM processes. Test specimens of polyamide 12 (PA-12) in its virgin form and used- , un-sintered form alongside specimens of used PA blended with TPU, aramid, or graphite, were produced in a micro-injection moulding machine and then tested for their mechanical properties. This paper provides information about the differences in mechanical characteristics of these different material blends. An unexpected but positive finding was that the differences between virgin and recycled PA-12 are insignificant. The aforementioned additives influenced PA-12 by producing specimens that responded with predictable characteristics which is a significant accomplishment as it lays the groundwork for the next stages of the project.},

abstract = {Environmentally sound management of plastic packaging waste is an issue of concern around the world because it causes potential threats to oceans and the environment upon disposal and mismanagement. This study examines the current efforts on recycling of the waste by extended producer responsibility (EPR) in South Korea as well as other countries. Material flow analysis (MFA) was performed on plastic packaging by life cycle. Based on the results in this study, material footprint of common single use plastics (i.e., PET water bottles, plastic cups, plastic bags, and plastic containers and cutlery by food delivery) by consumption was estimated to be on average 11.8 kg or 638 disposable plastics per capita a year, resulting in 32.6 billion disposable plastics and 603,000 ton of waste for disposal in South Korea. Approximately, 3 million ton of plastic packaging waste from household waste streams in 2017 in South Korea was generated and treated by energy recovery with solid refuse fuels and heat recovery, incineration without energy recovery, material recycling, and landfilling. Material recycling and recovery rates of plastic packaging waste from households were relatively low at 13.5{\%} and 50.5{\%}, respectively. It was estimated that as much as 3.6 million ton of CO2eq was generated from 2.7 million ton of plastic waste by incineration in 2017. Approximately 6.6 million ton CO2eq could be avoided by material recycling. Challenges and efforts have been discussed to improve current recycling system of plastic packaging waste towards a circular economy.},

abstract = {The recent development of open-source 3-D printers makes scaling of distributed additive-based manu- facturing of high-value objects technically feasible and offers the potential for widespread proliferation of mechatronics education and participation. These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manu- facture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technol- ogy for an average US household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20 open-source printable designs (rep- resenting less than 0.02{\%} of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet mar- ket prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about {\$}300 to {\$}2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between {\textgreater}200{\%} and {\textgreater}40{\%}. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average US household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing expo- nentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device},

abstract = {Although literature on open eco-innovation has recently increased, empirical research on this topic in traditional low-tech sectors is still relatively scarce. The present paper examines how open innovation activities can promote eco-innovations in the food industry, an industry that is sometimes considered a technological laggard with traditionally low cooperation. The paper focuses on the relationship between a firm's interactions with stakeholders, particularly the breadth and the depth of the firm's knowledge network and the firm's propensity to develop different types of eco-innovations. Using a novel and more accurate measure of breadth and depth and addressing endogeneity with instrumental variables, the paper studies their influence on technological eco-innovation in a random sample of 279 food firms in Spain. The results show that coordination difficulties and bounded rationality explain an inverted U shape in the relationship of breadth of external knowledge sources and the propensity to eco-innovate both in product and process eco-innovations. Additionally, our findings confirm that it is important to rely on deep, frequent and intense relationships with stakeholders in order to create the required atmosphere to foster fluent knowledge sharing among partners specially to develop eco-process innovations, but a learning effect appears. Future research should extend the analysis to other countries and sectors to address the limitations of this study.},

But what happens when these entities consciously join forces and share resources to create social change? It's happening more than you might think-in a growing phenomenon known as social innovation labs. And Labcraft offers an intimate picture of this new and evolving landscape-where seemingly disparate stakeholders network and align as learning communities who collaborate for positive change. Social labs do what we expect laboratories to do-invent and experiment. But their "test tubes" are real-world challenges. And as they explore new connections, new ideas, and new initiatives, they often generate new perspectives and promising solutions. A fittingly collaborative effort in itself, Labcraft was written in a four-day "Book Sprint" by representatives from seven innovation labs from around the world. These practitioners share their stories, experiences and perspectives, and consider their commonalities and differences. They offer humble observations about their struggles and successes, and detail how they navigate their unique dilemmas and paradoxes. From workspaces and funding to impact measurement and power dynamics, Labcraft explores what it takes to cultivate a nimble and responsive environment-and gives a face to the poignant potential of these creative new collaborations. Change makers everywhere will be uplifted and inspired by this hopeful, fascinating window into emerging frontiers for building a better world.},

abstract = {Urgent solutions are needed in Europe to deal with construction and demolition waste (CDW). EU policy has contributed to significantly reducing the amount of CDW going to landfill, but most of the effort has been put in downcycling practices. Therefore, further policies are needed to stimulate high-quality recycling of CDW. The present paper presents a combined life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) methodologies to analyse the environmental and the economic drivers in four alternative CDW end-of-life scenarios in the region of Flanders, in Belgium. The four analysed alternatives are (i) landfilling, (ii) downcycling, (iii) advanced recycling and (iv) recycling after selective demolition. LCA results show that landiflling is the scenario having the highest environmental impacts in terms of person equivalent (PE), followed by downcycling and recycling (-36{\%}) and recycling after selective demolition (−59{\%}). The decrease in environmental impacts is mostly due to the avoided landfilling of CDW and the recovery of materials from selective demolition. LCC results indicate that landfilling is the scenario bearing the highest total economic costs. This is due to the high landfill tax in Flanders. The recycling after selective demolition bears the second highest cost. The increase of high-quality CDW recycling can significantly reduce the overall environmental impact of the system. Implementing a high landfill tax, increasing the gate fee to the recycling plant, and boosting the sales price of recycled aggregates are the most effective drivers to facilitate a transition towards a more sustainable CDW management system. The paper demonstrates that the combined LCA and LCC results can highlight the environmental and economic drivers in CDW management. The results of the combined analysis can help policymakers to promote the aspects contributing to sustainability and to limit the ones creating a barrier.},

abstract = {Plastics have outgrown most man-made materials and have long been under environmental scrutiny. However, robust global information, particularly about their end-of-life fate, is lacking. By identifying and synthesizing dispersed data on production, use, and end-of-life management of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives, we present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured. We estimate that 8300 million metric tons (Mt) as of virgin plastics have been produced to date. As of 2015, approximately 6300 Mt of plastic waste had been generated, around 9{\%} of which had been recycled, 12{\%} was incinerated, and 79{\%} was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. If current production and waste management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.},

abstract = {Plastics have been the most consumed materials of human societies in recent decades and, in the mean time, one of the major products obtained from landfill mining. Characteristics of the landfill mined plastic wastes and their recovery potential were the key points to determine the feasibility of landfill mining projects. We collected municipal solid waste samples of different storage years from the landfill and did mechanical screening and manual separating to sort out plastic wastes, and a typical old landfill, which is of 24 storage years and located in central China, was taken as our studied case. According to our research, plastic wastes accounted for 10.62 ± 5.12{\%} of the total stored wastes in the old landfill, among which, 69.13{\%} was plastic bags (white PE plastic bags accounted for 11.34{\%}; colored PE plastic bags 29.77{\%}; other plastic bags 28.02{\%}), and 30.87{\%} was other plastics (incl. PP, PVC, PS, etc.). The average moisture content in the plastic waste was 19.96 ± 4.65{\%} and the average impurities content was 71.02 ± 6.31{\%} before manual washing and cleaning. The VS, ash, fixed carbon and calorific value of manually cleaned plastic wastes were 87.09 ± 0.55{\%}, 10.84 ± 1.19{\%}, 2.07 ± 0.85{\%} and 43.18 ± 1.49 MJ kg-1, respectively. Elements testing (C, N, O, S, Cl, Si, Al) and surface images analysis under scanning electron microscope showed that normal cleaning techniques had a difficulty in thoroughly getting rid of all the impurities on the surface of plastic bags excavated from old landfill, which will impede plastic wastes from being mechanical recycled as renewable materials or being chemically recycled by either pyrolysis, gasification, hydrogenation. Incineration or treating as residue derived fuels (RDFs) for recovering energy was the most practical way to process landfill mining plastic wastes under the normal cleaning techniques. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study aims to identify, from among business strategies presented in Miles and Snow (1978, 2003), those that increase the future performance or growth sustainability of unlisted small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Korea. (This study applied the scope of SMEs based on Article 2 of the Enforcement Decree of the Tax Exemption Restriction Act in Korea. The Korean tax law sets the scope of SMEs based on independence criteria set by the scale of sales, assets, and affiliation, and subordination. For example, the size standard of a manufacturing industry can be regarded as a small business if the average sales amount is less than 150 billion won or the total amount of assets is less than 500 billion won for three years.) In addition, it analyzes measured variables of business strategy for factors influencing unlisted SMEs' future performance and growth potential. The objective is to determine a business strategy for unlisted SMEs, which are small, financially challenged, and have shorter lifespans and faster growth rates. The results highlight that investment in research and development (R{\&}D) for new products influences both future performance and growth sustainability. R{\&}D is an important intangible resource of the firm, which increases future risk due to high future uncertainty, but it is also an important factor to increase future performance or value based on resource-based theory. In the accounting field, research and development expenditure also provided evidence of future excess return or performance. This study is meaningful because it identifies the role of research and development in increasing future growth sustainability in SMEs, thus emphasizing change and innovation.},

China has long been a key trading partner for the West's waste materials. However, its rethinking of the quality of traded recyclable materials has triggered a crisis in the global governance of waste flows. We utilise a Sociology of Knowledge approach to undertake comparative work to better understand how different governance arrangements may facilitate or constrain the unfolding of a CE transition. The UK and China were selected as models of liberal and authoritarian environmental governance respectively. A mixed-method approach was pursued using qualitative interviews with key stakeholders and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from secondary sources. Thematic analysis is organised around: perceptions of the circular economy, meanings of standards, and perspectives on trade and materials.},

abstract = {Purpose – Despite the widespread expectation that additive manufacturing (AM) will become a disruptive technology to transform the spare parts supply chain, very limited research has been devoted to the quantitative modeling and analysis on how AM could fulfill the on-demand spare parts supply. On the other hand, the choice of using AM as a spare parts supply strategy over traditional inventory is a rising decision faced by manufacturers and requires quantitative analysis for their AM-or-stock decisions. The purpose of this paper is to develop a quantitative performance model for a generic powder bed fusion AM system in a spare parts supply chain, thus providing insights into this less-explored area in the literature. Design/methodology/approach – In this study, analysis based on a discrete event simulation was carried out for the use of AM in replacement of traditional warehouse inventory for an on-demand spare parts supply system. Generic powder bed fusion AM system was used in the model, and the same modeling approach could be applied to other types of AM processes. Using this model, the impact of both spare parts demand characteristics (e.g. part size attributes, demand rates) and the AM operations characteristics (e.g. machine size and postpone strategy) on the performance of using AM to supply spare parts was studied. Findings – The simulation results show that in many cases the AM operation is not as cost competitive compared to the traditional warehouse- based spare parts supply operation, and that the spare parts size characteristics could significantly affect the overall performance of the AM operations. For some scenarios of the arrival process of spare parts demand, the use of the batched AM production could potentially result in significant delay in parts delivery, which necessitates further investigations of production optimization strategies. Originality/value – The findings demonstrate that the proposed simulation tool can not only provide insights on the performance characteristics of using AM in the spare parts supply chain, especially in comparison to the traditional warehousing system, but also can be used toward decision making for both the AM manufacturers and the spare parts service providers.},

abstract = {Manufacturing paradigms have historically been shaped by social, economic, and technological aspect, including limitations and needs. Design for manufacturing (DFM) has been the main paradigm for last three decades since design is defined by the limitations of available manufacturing processes. Since reducing the time required for the development of new products has been one of the key issues for businesses, removing the gap between designers and manufacturers has been one of today's main goals. Many methods were developed to reduce this gap including information and communication technologies (ICT). However, current issues have been shifting towards design-related issues such that researchers have been trying to make products desired by the customers rather than that which is cheaper to manufacture. In this article, hybrid manufacturing (HM) and the concept of smart factory are introduced as key technologies for the future paradigm of manufacturing: Manufacturing for Design (MFD). Issues related to the development of HM process and examples of HM process are explained, and the importance of smart factories for the implementation of MFD is shown. Finally, future trends of HM and smart factory are predicted at the end of this article. {\textcopyright} 2016 Korean Society for Precision Engineering.},

abstract = {The market for homemade and handcrafted items has expanded significantly in recent years. Related activities range from community-supported agricultural activities, tinkering at home, renovating our houses, design elements, and defining space in the world of gastronomy and fashion as well, and it extends to cover many other activities, where the "producers" also double up as the consumers. The number of scientific analyses in Hungarian language dealing with this subject is very low and no deep empirical results (interviews, questionnaires, ethnographic analyses, etc.) to support our scientific experience exist yet. The purpose of this study is first to review the terminology issued and difficulties that are related to this phenomenon, and, based on the results of a questionnaire survey, and secondly to explore the motivations of DIYers and the attitudes behind their actions. In our study, we mean on Do-It-Yourself (DIY)-in line with the vast majority of literature-all activities, services, and products, which is implemented by own hands not under industrial circumstences. The target group of the online questionnaire survey was the people that are involved in DIY. The questionnaire was shared by a decorator and her DIY Facebook page ("Juditu") on 3 October 2017. The size of the relevant sample was 270. The research questionnaire was built up from a demographic part, a part that is related to general DIY activity, and a part that sought to find the motivation of DIY members. The practice of DIY activities might be linked more to the personality and creativity; so, the group can be more homogeneously described along the common personality traits than by demographic variables. Among the motivations of DIYers the economic one (saving money) is not the most dominant. Analyses by interpretative index categories confirmed the hypothesis that it is difficult to separate one motivational force from the other; in many cases, one catalysing force generates the other, thus a complex multifactorial motivational set dominates the study target group. From the three groups, which were identified by analysing the motivations, in two groups those individuals are dominant, which use DIY activities to express their own inner world, and for whom spending time creatively, making something alone and for themselves, and creating something useful and valuable, is very important. These results were novel and, naturally, they can be perfect starting points of further studies because of the intactness of the research topic.},

Co-innovation is defined as a shared work of generating innovative and exceptional design conducted by various actors from firms, customers, and collaborating partners. This study proposes that there are five principal elements within the idea of co-innovation: collaboration, coordination, co-creation, convergence and complementary. The possible outputs of co-innovation can either be a new business model, new customer base, new customer value, new value chain, or new products and services.

South Africa as per current classification, remains a twofold economy with among the greatest inequality rates in the world, continuing both disparity and segregation. Employment remains at more than one in three youth unemployed. A group of academics and commercial partners working across disciplines collaborate to create opportunities for local young people to participate in research and data gathering at the University of Johannesburg (UJ). The need for the enablement of technology especially among the youth of the African society has initiated a research question, which determines whether technological instruments can be developed and deployed in Africa to facilitate youth. A transformative but collaborative (researcher and community team), approach is the focus with youth employment as a key objective. Collaboration with local communities to gather household and sector specific data, UJ mobilizes cross-disciplinary research networks to drive social innovation. Joining strategies and technologies to develop appropriate, smart digital tools to support technological enablement for survey data collection in the informal sector in South Africa. The team develop a research methodology and digital tools, which enables geographic information systems (GIS) survey data collection over large geographical areas, at scale, which relies on rigorous data quality controls. Providing various opportunities to local young people in the digital, gig-economy through data collection and digital networking. The major perspective of this paper is to study the aspect of technology and the way it empowers young people on the African continent. The paper presents the design, evolution and results of the digital platform as developed for two major South African Projects.},

abstract = {Polymer production and utilization are currently widespread and have greatly improved people's standards of living. However, due to their stable and nonbiodegradable nature, postconsumer polymers pose challenging issues to the environment and ecosystems. Efforts are being made not only to contain the generation of polymer wastes and associated littering but, also, to find ways of utilizing them sustainably. Aside from mechanical recycling, which turns postconsumer polymers into new polymer products, and thermal recycling, which releases the thermal energy contained within waste plastics through combustion, chemical recycling converts waste polymers into feedstock for chemicals/materials/fuels production. This manuscript reviews prior work on a special application of the particular chemical recycling route that converts polymers into carbon-based nanomaterials. These materials feature extraordinary physical and chemical properties with tremendous applications potential. However, their production processes are both resource- and energy-intensive. Yet, by taking advantage of the high carbon content of waste polymers, as well as of their high energy content, a cost-effective, environmentally-friendly, and self-sustaining production of carbon nanomaterials can be achieved. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Organizational ‘innovation laboratories', dedicated facilities for encouraging creative behaviours and supporting innovative projects, have received scant academic attention despite their increasing popularity with a range of different practitioners. This paper develops an initial theoretical explanation of the phenomenon, based upon notions of organizational learning and dynamic capabilities. This framework is then used as the basis for analysing the structure, infrastructure, benefits and dis-benefits of three UK-based laboratory facilities (mass service, government department, academic institution). Preliminary conclusions suggest that the ‘innovation laboratory' can offer real benefits for organizations: reinforcing corporate commitment to innovation and creativity by providing a physical manifestation of dynamic capability and double-loop learning concepts. Although the physical design of the space is central to its functionality – emphasizing dislocation from day-to-day activity, eliminating hierarchy, encouraging participation – direct facilitation remains critical to successful operation. There are also dis-benefits associated with what can be substantial financial investments and there is some evidence that such facilities can have a relatively short useful lifespan. Given the limited nature of the empirical base, the paper concludes with some specific suggestions for further work.},

abstract = {National and regional governments around the world are steering actors in the waste and resources management industry towards a more circular economy (CE). Such a hoped-for transition is set against a backdrop of neoliberal environmental governance. The private sector increasingly delivers outcomes via public-private initiatives. Similarly, voluntary quality assurance standards covering flows of waste and resources around the globe are increasingly central to markets and trade. The role of standards in contemporary environmental governance is critically reassessed by examining how they are involved in the upscaling or down-scaling of markets. This analysis matters to understanding how the CE is conceptualised at a range of scales and how neoliberal environmental governance can help or hinder CE development. To overcome the paucity of data on how and why public and private sector actors set and use voluntary standards for material flows, twenty-eight key actor interviews with those involved in standard setting and the CE in Europe are drawn upon. Results suggest that proponents of standards and the CE see the raising of the quality of recycled material as central to building up confidence and trust in existing and emerging markets. However, others suggest markets will always privilege cost over quality and that standards are peripheral. For the CE transition to accelerate, this research suggests that policy instruments like standards need to challenge existing neoliberal market relations rather than simply follow them.},

abstract = {Context: In a previous study, we reported on a systematic literature review (SLR), based on a manual search of 13 journals and conferences undertaken in the period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2007. Objective: The aim of this on-going research is to provide an annotated catalogue of SLRs available to software engineering researchers and practitioners. This study updates our previous study using a broad automated search. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs published in the time period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2008. We contrast the number, quality and source of these SLRs with SLRs found in the original study. Results: Our broad search found an additional 35 SLRs corresponding to 33 unique studies. Of these papers, 17 appeared relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum and 12 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. The number of SLRs being published is increasing. The quality of papers in conferences and workshops has improved as more researchers use SLR guidelines. Conclusion: SLRs appear to have gone past the stage of being used solely by innovators but cannot yet be considered a main stream software engineering research methodology. They are addressing a wide range of topics but still have limitations, such as often failing to assess primary study quality. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A sample of 231 companies was collected, 58 from emerging countries and 173 from developed countries. The methodology was based on structural equation modeling and regression with panel data. The study revealed that nearly all environmental and social eco-innovation variables were significant in their respective dimensions in the developed countries, whereas in the emerging countries, only two environmental and social variables were significant, thus highlighting the more advanced stage of eco-innovation in developed countries. The results of the regression with panel data indicated that the environmental and social variables were significant only for return on sales (ROS) and differed between companies located in emerging and developed countries.},

We show that the nonverbal cues to deceit discovered to date are faint and unreliable and that people are mediocre lie catchers when they pay attention to behavior. We also discuss why individuals hold misbeliefs about the relationship between nonverbal behavior and deception—beliefs that appear very hard to debunk. We further discuss the ways in which researchers could improve the state of affairs by examining nonverbal behaviors in different ways and in different settings than they currently do.},

@article{Dotchev2009,
abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the polyamide 12 (PA12) powder properties deterioration in the laser sintering (LS) process and propose a methodology for more efficient powder recycling. The main goals are: to recommend a level of input PA2200 powder properties which could guarantee acceptable part quality in the LS process; and selection of the refresh rate in order to minimise the consumption of fresh material. Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses the LS processing conditions and current recycling practices in relation to the deterioration or ageing of the PA12-based powders. Samples of new and recycled grades of PA2200 powder were artificially aged in a temperature-controlled oven and then tested using melt flow rate (MFR) indexer. Also, un-sintered powder samples collected from different locations within various builds, and different LS machines (EOSINT P700 and SinterstationUP/UP 2500 HiQ) were tested. Findings - The powder exposed at higher temperature and longer time experiences a much higher deterioration rate. The temperature and the time at which the un-sintered material was exposed are the most influential parameters for the powder aging. It was confirmed that the MFR index is a very sensitive indicator of the changes in the powder properties and provides a relatively fast and inexpensive method of measuring the rate of the powder degradation because of the LS process. The powder located in the periphery and the top of a build has a higher MFR and therefore is less deteriorated. In contrast, powder located in the centre, or in the bottom of a long build has much lower MFR and therefore is less usable. Practical implications - Based on the findings, a methodology for powder recycling is proposed. It allows a better control of the input material properties, a consistent quality of the fabricated parts, and more efficient use of the LS material. Originality/value - The paper provides some useful information for the properties deterioration of PA12-based powders (PA2200) in relation to the temperature and time at which the material is exposed in the LS. {\textcopyright} 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Material resources exploitation and the pressure on natural ecosystems have raised concerns over potential future resource risks and supply failures worldwide. Interest in the concept of Circular Economy has surged in recent years among policy makers and business actors. An increasing amount of literature touches upon the concep- tualisation of Circular Economy, the development of ‘cir- cular solutions' and circular business models, and policies for a Circular Economy. However, relevant studies on resource efficiency policies mostly utilise a case-by-case or sector-by-sector approach and do not consider the systemic interdependencies of the underlying operational policy framework. In this contribution, a mapping of the existing resource policy framework in the European Union (EU) is undertaken, and used as a basis for identifying policy areas that have been less prominent in influencing material resource efficiency. Employing a life cycle approach, policies affecting material efficiency in the production and consumption stages of a product have been found to be poorly utilised so far in the EU. Taking this as a point of departure, three policy areas that can contribute to closing material loops and increasing resource efficiency are thoroughly discussed and their application challenges are highlighted. The three policy areas are: (1) policies for reuse, repair and remanufacturing; (2) green public pro- curement and innovation procurement; and (3) policies for Handled by Fabio Orecchini, Department of Sustainability Engineering, Italy. {\&} Leonidas Milios leonidas.milios@iiiee.lu.se 1 International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics, Lund University, P.

abstract = {Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is an extrusion based Rapid prototyping (RP) technique which can be used to fabricate tissue engineering scaffolds. The present work focuses on the study of the melt flow behaviour (MFB) of Poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL) as a representative biomaterial, on the FDM. The MFB significantly affects the quality of the scaffold which depends not only on the pressure gradient, its velocity, and the temperature gradients but also physical properties like the melt temperature and rheology. The MFB is studied using two methods: mathematical modelling and finite element analysis (FEA) using Ansys(R). The MFB is studied using accurate channel geometry by varying filament velocity at the entry and by varying nozzle diameters and angles at the exit. The comparative results of both mathematical modelling and FEA suggest that the pressure drop and the velocities of the melt flow depend on the flow channel parameters. One inference of particular interest is the temperature gradient of the PCL melt, which shows that it liquefies within 35{\%} of the channel length. These results are invaluable to better understand the MFB of biomaterials that affects the quality of the scaffold built via FDM and can also be used to predict the MFB of other biomaterials.},

abstract = {A small percentage of South Africans regularly recycle most of their recyclables, which was only 4{\%} and 7.2{\%} in 2010 and 2015, respectively. This empirical quantitative study, the first study on this scale in South Africa, aimed to ascertain the reasons why people do not recycle. This paper reports the results from a survey conducted among a representative sample of 2004 respondents in eleven of South Africa's large urban areas. Each respondent selected three main reasons why people do not recycle from ten possible options as well as the one main reason. The results show that (i) insufficient space, (ii) no time, (iii) dirty and untidiness associated with recycling, (iv) lack of recycling knowledge, and (v) inconvenient recycling facilities are perceived as the main reasons why people do not recycle. Non-recycling households (74{\%} of the respondents) give high priority to time and knowledge. Low recyclers—those that sporadically recycle few items—and young South Africans give high priority to services (inconvenient facilities and no curbside collection). Lack of knowledge is an important factor for people from dense settlements as well as the unemployed looking for work. Improved recycling services such as regular curbside collections have the potential to overcome time and space barriers. Recycling services as well as recycling knowledge will have to improve to encourage the youth, the unemployed, and those living in informal areas to recycle and realize the opportunities locked in the waste sector. The perceptions of respondents from non-recycling households differ from those from recycling households. The larger representation of non-recyclers in developing countries emphasize the importance of understanding local evidence when comparing and implementing results from developed countries. The learning from this study could also assist other developing countries to encourage household participation in recycling initiatives.},

abstract = { Abstract—Upcycling is a process in which used materials are converted into something of higher value and/or quality in their second life. It has been increasingly recognised as one promising means to reduce material and energy use, and to engender sustainable production and consumption. For this reason and other foreseeable benefits, the concept of upcycling has received more attention from numerous researchers and business practitioners in recent years. This has been seen in the growing number of publications on this topic since the 1990s. However, the overall volume of literature dealing with upcycling is still low and no major review has been presented. Therefore, in order to further establish this field, this paper analyses and summarises the current body of literature on upcycling, focusing on different definitions, trends in practices, benefits, drawbacks and barriers in a number of subject areas, and gives suggestions for future research by illuminating knowledge gaps in the area of upcycling.},

abstract = {3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer design using patient-specific anatomical data. Since its initial use as pre-surgical visualization models and tooling molds, 3D Printing has slowly evolved to create one-of-a-kind devices, implants, scaffolds for tissue engineering, diagnostic platforms, and drug delivery systems. Fueled by the recent explosion in public interest and access to affordable printers, there is renewed interest to combine stem cells with custom 3D scaffolds for personalized regenerative medicine. Before 3D Printing can be used routinely for the regeneration of complex tissues (e.g. bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, nerves in the craniomaxillofacial complex), and complex organs with intricate 3D microarchitecture (e.g. liver, lymphoid organs), several technological limitations must be addressed. In this review, the major materials and technology advances within the last five years for each of the common 3D Printing technologies (Three Dimensional Printing, Fused Deposition Modeling, Selective Laser Sintering, Stereolithography, and 3D Plotting/Direct-Write/Bioprinting) are described. Examples are highlighted to illustrate progress of each technology in tissue engineering, and key limitations are identified to motivate future research and advance this fascinating field of advanced manufacturing.},

Apr{\`{e}}s une ann{\'{e}}e d'enqu{\^{e}}tes de terrain et les activit{\'{e}}s des experts du groupe de travail, ce Livre blanc souligne que les open labs sont autant un dispositif pour d{\'{e}}velopper de nouvelles approches de l'innovation qu'un vecteur de transformation des organisations. Nous proposons des outils de diagnostic strat{\'{e}}gique pour les porteurs de chaque type d'open labs analys{\'{e}} dans cette {\'{e}}tude (entreprises, institutions acad{\'{e}}miques, organi- sations publiques, start ups). Ce Livre blanc permet de mieux comprendre les objectifs des open labs, leurs caract{\'{e}}ristiques en tant qu'espaces physiques et lieux d'{\'{e}}changes et de production, les pratiques, comme les d{\'{e}}marches d'open innovation qu'ils portent. Le pilotage des open labs varie en outre selon qu'ils sont issus d'initiatives individuelles ou qu'ils sont mis en place par des organisations. D'autres aspects portent sur la multidisciplinarit{\'{e}} au sein de l'open lab, et sur la vari{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} des comp{\'{e}}tences ou des profi ls qui contribuent {\`{a}} ses activit{\'{e}}s. On trouvera enfi n tous les {\'{e}}l{\'{e}}ments qui portent sur la gouvernance de l'open lab, et sur les strat{\'{e}}gies de fi nancement ou de labellisation.

abstract = {Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Bangladesh have been growing for the preceding two decades in various ways. Even though these enterprises exert an important effect on the national economy of the country, they face certain challenges and suffer in quite a manner. To reduce the suffering and help deal with these unavoidable challenges, SME foundations in Bangladesh have been working a lot to assist these enterprises. Usually, the challenges are financial, regulatory, or innovation performance-related. Since the enterprises are focused on particular products and their manifestation and production, performing innovatively within these organizations becomes quite a constraint factor. In this paper, a qualitative method was applied with soft systems, where an innovation model was commenced to reduce the challenges and constraints of SMEs in Bangladesh. From the literature, 50 articles were analyzed, a content and thematic analysis was done, and eight main challenges were highlighted and finalized. On the other hand, a focus group discussion among 10 entrepreneurs in Bangladesh was done, where collected data were stored in the NVIVOMac tool, transcribed, and coded, and 55 open codes were identified. These open codes were transferred to 20 axial codes and 8 themes to construct a conceptual innovation model for SMEs in Bangladesh by applying soft systems techniques to connect the themes to each other.},

This article is an extension of work reported on thermo-mechanical investigations on waste thermosetting polymer bakelite and ceramic (silicon carbide and aluminium oxide) as reinforcement in recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) thermoplastic matrix for sustainability. The study reports the experimental investigations on mechanical (tensile), morphological, surface hardness and thermal stability analysis of 3D printed functional prototype as tensile specimen (as per ASTM D 638). In the present case study, it has been ascertained that composition/proportion of thermoplastic matrix has a significant role in controlling the mechanical properties, whereas other input process parameters of FDM are insignificant.

The process involves design of the tool using 3D CAD modeling, slicing of the data into cross sections, laser beam cutting of the sheets into 2D profiles, lamination, bonding, milling and finishing. This technology allows to include complex cooling channels in order to achieve a significant reduction of the cycle time and to control the cooling process. Because of the low bonding temperature and force, large tools can be made in a time- and cost-effective manner. The manufacturing system is similar to the technology developed by Nakagawa et al.; however, the used sheet material is different and therefore, the bonding method. In this article, the introduced bonding technique, laser cutting, milling and other important parameters such as bonding strength are discussed.},

abstract = {Over the years, the world was not paying strict attention to the impact of rapid growth in plastic use. This has led to unprecedented amounts of mixed types of plastic waste entering the environment unmanaged. Packaging plastics account for half of the global total plastic waste. This paper seeks to give an overview of the use, disposal, and regulation of food packaging plastics. Demand for food packaging is on the rise as a result of increasing global demand for food due to population growth. Most of the food packaging are used on-the-go and are single use plastics that are disposed of within a short space of time. The bulk of this plastic waste has found its way into the environment contaminating land, water and the food chain. The food industry is encouraged to reduce, reuse and recycle packaging materials. A wholistic approach to waste management will need to involve all stakeholders working to achieve a circular economy. A robust approach to prevent pollution today rather than handling the waste in the future should be adopted especially in Africa where there is high population growth.},

Different ratios of micro-ground macadamia nutshells and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastics were mixed with a binding agent to extrude a range of filaments. By using a commercial 3D printer, these filaments helped to fabricate specimens that were tested in tension and compression. The results show that printed samples of macadamia-nutshell�{\_}"ABS composites offer a viable alternative to commercially available wood polymer composite filaments. Although they possess similar mechanical properties, they have a lower density, making them suitable for a range of lightweight product applications. The research demonstrates that there are new opportunities for the use of macadamia nutshell filament in additive manufacturing as a result of its enhanced properties compared with traditional wood filaments},

abstract = {Learning processes play a crucial role in the development of the transformative capacity of social innovation actors. This article builds on the recently developed Transformative Social Innovation (TSI) theory to propose a conceptual framework and research agenda for understanding and investigating the roles and limits of network leadership in supporting learning processes that serve to develop the transformative capacity of social innovation. This focus on network leadership is underdeveloped so far in TSI theory. Addressing this research gap also serves to increase the practical relevance of TSI theory to practitioners engaged in network leadership. After presenting a synopsis of TSI theory, we present an overview of the elements of the conceptual framework, which are successively specified throughout the article. First, transformative change is conceptualized, involving three institutional dimensions: depth, width and length. Based on this, a definition of transformative capacity is proposed that addresses change across these three dimensions. We then describe how various types of learning processes can contribute to the development of transformative capacity. Next, we outline the roles of network leadership in supporting these learning processes across various network levels. We conclude with a research agenda for empirically investigating these roles of network leaders as agents for advancing transformative changes for sustainability.},

abstract = {This new interdisciplinary work presents system dynamics as a powerful approach to enable analysts build simulation models of social systems, with a view toward enhancing decision making. Grounded in the feedback perspective of complex systems, the book provides a practical introduction to system dynamics, and covers key concepts such as stocks, flows, and feedback. Societal challenges such as predicting the impact of an emerging infectious disease, estimating population growth, and assessing the capacity of health services to cope with demographic change can all benefit from the application of computer simulation. This text explains important building blocks of the system dynamics approach, including material delays, stock management heuristics, and how to model effects between different systemic elements. Models from epidemiology, health systems, and economics are presented to illuminate important ideas, and the R programming language is used to provide an open-source and interoperable way to build system dynamics models. System Dynamics Modeling with R also describes hands-on techniques that can enhance client confidence in system dynamic models, including model testing, model analysis, and calibration. Developed from the author's course in system dynamics, this book is written for undergraduate and postgraduate students of management, operations research, computer science, and applied mathematics. Its focus is on the fundamental building blocks of system dynamics models, and its choice of R as a modeling language make it an ideal reference text for those wishing to integrate system dynamics modeling with related data analytic methods and techniques.

Furthermore, a novel method of measuring shrinkage in 3D printed components was also developed and used to assess shrinkage of filaments. The most successful filaments contained 30 wt{\%} harakeke fibre and had a tensile strength and Young's modulus of 39 MPa and 2.8 GPa respectively, providing improvements in tensile strength and Young's modulus compared to those of plain PP filament of 74{\%} and 214{\%} respectively. However, these properties were seen to reduce on printing, although fibre reinforcement was still observed to provide benefit in terms of strength and shrinkage. The cause of the mechanical property reduction was assumed to be stress relaxation of the polymer during printing which is conducted at lower pressure compared to filament production. 30 wt{\%} harakeke filament also underwent the least shrinkage of 0.34{\%} corresponding to a net reduction of 84{\%} relative to plain PP.},

abstract = {Roads form a vast, rapidly growing global network that has diverse, detrimental ecological impacts. However, the habitats that border roads (‘road verges') form a parallel network that might help mitigate these impacts and provide additional benefits (ecosystem services; ES). We evaluate the capacity of road verges to provide ES by reviewing existing research and considering their relevant characteristics: area, connectivity, shape, and contextual ES supply and demand. We consider the present situation, and how this is likely to change based on future projections for growth in road extent, traffic densities and urban populations. Road verges not only provide a wide range of ES, including biodiversity provision, regulating services (e.g. air and water filtration) and cultural services (e.g. health and aesthetic benefits by providing access to nature) but also displace other habitats and provide ecosystem disservices (e.g. plant allergens and damage to infrastructure). Globally, road verges may currently cover 270,000 km2 and store 0.015 Gt C/year, which will further increase with 70{\%} projected growth in the global road network. Road verges are well placed to mitigate traffic pollution and address demand for ES in surrounding ES-impoverished landscapes, thereby improving human health and well-being in urban areas, and improving agricultural production and sustainability in farmland. Demand for ES provided by road verges will likely increase due to projected growth in traffic densities and urban populations, though traffic pollution will be reduced by technological advances (e.g. electric vehicles). Road verges form a highly connected network, which may enhance ES provision but facilitate the dispersal of invasive species and increase vehicle–wildlife collisions. Synthesis and applications. Road verges offer a significant opportunity to mitigate the negative ecological effects of roads and to address demand for ecosystem services (ES) in urban and agricultural landscapes. Their capacity to provide ES might be enhanced considerably if they were strategically designed and managed for environmental outcomes, namely by optimizing the selection, position and management of plant species and habitats. Specific opportunities include reducing mowing frequencies and planting trees in large verges. Road verge management for ES must consider safety guidelines, financial costs and ecosystem disservices, but is likely to provide long-term financial returns if environmental benefits are considered.},

abstract = {In this research, the effect of reprocessing of acrylonitrile-butadiene- styrene (ABS) on the mechanical properties of the polymer was studied through a five-stage reprocessing. To this end, the injection mold of the standard samples was manufactured. Then, using an injection molding machine, all of the virgin material was processed. After sampling, the rest of the parts were ground and then reprocessed under the same conditions. In order to get a proper combinational ratio of virgin and recycled ABS with respect to shrinkage and mechanical properties, another experiment was designed. In order to do this, virgin material was blended with 20{\%}, 35{\%} and 50{\%} of the recycled material. The blends were reprocessed and samples were obtained. Impact, tensile, flexural and shrinkage tests, selected from ASTM standard, were used to investigate the mechanical properties of the polymer as well as its shrinkage. Furthermore, viscosity test was used to investigate the changes in the structure of the polymer. As the reprocessing cycles increased, shrinkage decreased and tensile and flexural ultimate strengths increased, more in flexural strength than in tensile. While Young's modulus slightly increased, viscosity decreased and consequently molecular weight decreased too. The proper blend for the least shrinkage was 50{\%} whereas the best mechanical properties were achievable by the 20{\%} blend. The obtained results suggest that reprocessing causes polymer degradation which is a result of the break in the bonds of poly butadiene. Moreover, it can be concluded that reprocessing in ABS can lead to the loss of effectiveness of some additives. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has been altering industries as evidenced by Airbnb, Uber and other companies that have embraced its use to implement innovative new business models. Yet we may not fully understand how this emerging and rapidly advancing technology influences business model innovation. While many companies are being made vulnerable to new competitors equipped with AI technology, this study attempts to focus on the proactive side of the use of AI technology to drive business model innovation. Describing AI technology as the catalyst of business model innovation, this study sheds light on contingent factors shaping business model innovation initiated by the emerging technology. This study first provides a brief overview of AI, current issues being tackled in developing AI and explains how it transforms business models. Our case study of two companies that innovated their business models using AI shows its potential impact. We also discuss how executives can create an innovative AI-based culture, which rephrases the process of AI-based business model innovation. Companies that successfully capitalize on AI can create disruptive innovation through their new business models and processes, enabling them to potentially transform the global competitive landscape.},

In this paper, findings are reported from a study that involved development of a new type of 3-D printer. In particular, a novel 3-D printer that is designed specifically for reliable rapid manufacturing at the sites of humanitarian crises. First, required capabilities are developed with design elements of a humanitarian 3-D printer, which include, (1) fused filament fabrication, (2) open source self-replicating rapid prototyper design, (3) modular, (4) separate frame, (5) protected electronics, (6) on-board computing, (7) flexible power supply, and (8) climate control mechanisms. The technology is then disclosed with an open source license for the Kijenzi 3-D Printer. A swarm of five Kijenzi 3-D printers are evaluated for rapid part manufacturing for two months at health facilities and other community locations in both rural and urban areas throughout Kisumu County, Kenya. They were successful for their ability to function independently of infrastructure, transportability, ease of use, ability to withstand harsh environments and costs. The results are presented and conclusions are drawn about future work necessary for the Kijenzi 3-D Printer to meet the needs of rapid manufacturing in a humanitarian context.},

@article{Allen2015,
abstract = {Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is an additive manufacturing (AM) method that relies on the thermal extrusion of a thermoplastic feedstock from a mobile deposition head. Conventional FFF constructs components from stacks of individual extruded layers using tool paths with fixed z-values in each individual layer. Consequently, the manufactured components often contain inherent weaknesses in the z-axis due to the relatively weak thermal fusion bonding that occurs between individual layers, as well as poor surface finish in shallow sloped contours. This study demonstrates the use of Curved Layer FFF (CLFFF) tool paths in tandem with a commercially available parallel, or delta, style FFF system to allow the deposition head to follow the topology of the component. By incorporating a delta robot and CLFFF tool paths in this way, improvements in the surface finish of the manufactured parts has been observed, and time costs associated with Cartesian robot based CLFFF manufacturing have been notably reduced. Furthermore, employing a delta robot provides additional flexibility to CLFFF manufacturing and increases the feasibility of its application for advanced manufacturing. The study has also demonstrated a viable approach to multi-material FFF by decoupling support structure and part manufacture into regions of CLFFF and static z tool pathing in an appropriate fashion.},

Today these technologies are proliferating worldwide in various forms of advanced manufacturing. The largest segment of the 3D printing market today involves various polymer component fabrications, particularly complex structures not attainable by other manufacturing methods. Conventional printer head systems have also been adapted to selectively print various speciated human cells and special molecules in attempts to construct human organs, beginning with skin and various tissue patches. These efforts are discussed along with metal and alloy fabrication of a variety of implant and bone replacement components by creating powder layers, which are selectively melted into complex forms (such as foams and other open-cellular structures) using laser and electron beams directed by CAD software. Efforts to create a ???living implant??? by bone ingrowth and eventual vascularization within these implants will be discussed briefly. Novel printer heads for direct metal droplet deposition as in other 3D printing systems are briefly described since these concepts will allow for the eventual fabrication of very large and complex products, including automotive and aerospace structures and components.},

abstract = {In this research work an effort has been made to develop in house feed stock filament wire made up of recycled polymer waste as base matrix with SiC/Al2O3reinforcement for sustainable development. The process starts with collection of waste polymer (high density polyethylene (HDPE) as a case study) from local industry. After manual segregation of contamination from waste polymer, initially rheological and thermal properties like: melt flow index (MFI), melting temperature, decomposition and enthalpy of the base polymer as well as reinforced with ceramic particle in different proportions, were tested. Further based upon thermal properties different proportions of HDPE, SiC and Al2O3were prepared by using mini compounder (twin screw extruder) to ensure uniform dispersion. After this single screw extruder was used to prepare filament wire of uniform diameter for fused deposition modelling (FDM) setup. The filament wire so prepared was tested for its tensile properties by using universal testing machine (UTM) and various mechanical properties like: peak strength, break strength, percentage elongation and peak load etc. were established. Finally scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were obtained to understand the distribution of ceramic particles in filament wire. This study highlights the detailed procedure for managing the polymer waste with novel method by using recycled polymer as rapid tooling. This will enhance the sustainability and also helps to develop low cost, in-house open source FDM setup, rapid tooling (as ceramic particles in filament wire will enhance surface properties).},

abstract = {Keywords: circular economy circular design circular business models industrial design architecture sustainability a b s t r a c t The transition to a circular economy (CE) produces a range of new challenges for designers and requires specific knowledge, strategies, and methods. To date, most studies regarding design for a CE have been theoretical and conceptual, hence, limited research has been conducted on the practical implications of designing for a CE. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide a better understanding of how design practitioners interpret and implement the CE concept in practice. To capture the complexity of real-world cases, semi-structured interviews were carried out with design practitioners (N = 12) within the disciplines of architecture and industrial design who have actively worked with circularity in a design agency setting. The results show that the practitioners have diverse perspectives on designing for a CE, relating to (1) the circular design process, (2) the effects of the CE on design agencies, (3) the changing role of the designer, and (4) the external factors affecting circular design in practice. Some differences were identified between the architects and industrial designers, with the industrial designers more strongly focused on circular business models and the architects on the reuse of materials on a building level. In addition, circular strategies and associated (similar) terminologies were understood and applied in fundamentally different ways. As the CE blurs boundaries of scale and disciplines, there is a need for universal design frameworks and language. The CE concept is expanding the scope of the design process and driving the integration of new knowledge fields and skills in the design process. The successful implementation of the CE in practice is based on extensive collaboration with stakeholders and experts throughout all stages of the design process. Design agencies have addressed the CE by establishing dedicated CE research and design teams, facilitating knowledge exchange, developing their own circular strategies and methods, and striving for long-term client relationships that foster the engagement of designers with the lifecycles of designed artefacts rather than perceiving design projects as temporary endeavors. Ultimately, a holistic and integral approach towards design in a CE is needed to ensure that the underlying CE goals of contributing to sustainable development and establishing a systemic shift are ongoingly considered.},

@article{EllenMacArthurFoundation2015,
abstract = {The circular economy is gaining increasing attention in Europe and around the world as a potential way for our society to increase prosperity, while reducing dependence on primary materials and energy. The European Commission is expected to propose a “circular economy package” by the end of 2015, and many business leaders embrace the circular economy as a path to increasing growth and profitability. At the same time, a lively debate is going on about the attractiveness of a circular economy for different stakeholders and its implications for employment, growth, and the environment. This report aims to contribute to a fact base to inform this debate, especially in Europe. The report suggests what a circular European economy could look like and compares its potential impact with the current development path. The report models potential European economic and environmental outcomes in both scenarios. It also examines how a more circular way of satisfying human needs could play out in three of the largest and most resource-intensive European value chains: mobility, food, and the built environment. In aggregate, the circular scenarios suggest that the opportunity for Europe's economy could be large. The report does not aim to provide final answers or projections for a circular economy—this would be impossible given the major uncertainties involved in the transition. Rather, the report tries to identify and describe major differences that circularity could bring to the European economy and offers directional quantification of the most important differences. In doing so, the report builds on previous circular economy research, including work by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment. This report is the product of a knowledge partnership between the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Stiftungsfonds f{\"{u}}r Umwelt{\"{o}}konomie und Nachhaltigkeit (SUN),the new environmental economics branch of the Deutsche Post Foundation, and the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment. We encourage policy-makers inspired by the vision presented in this report to read the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's new and complementary report, Delivering the circular economy: A toolkit for policy-makers. The toolkit offers an actionable, step-by-step methodology to help transition towards a circular economy. We are grateful to our numerous partners and advisors for their insights and support throughout this project, as acknowledged in the pages that follow. This report has truly been a collaborative effort by business, policy-makers, and academia. We hope you find this report informative and useful. We invite you to engage with us on this timely opportunity.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the ageing behaviour of acrylate-based resins for stereolithography (SL) technology using different test methods and to investigate these effects on polymers. Design/methodology/ approach - Controlling the polymer degradation requires an understanding of many different phenomena, including the different chemical mechanisms underlying structural changes in polymer macromolecules, the influences of polymer morphology, the complexities of oxidation chemistry and the complex reaction pathways of polymer additives. Several ageing characterization experiments are given. Findings - The paper covers the ageing process analysis of acrylate-based polymers. An overview of the ageing behaviour is given, along with the bandwidth of material characteristics for a prolonged lifetime of this material class. Research limitations/implications - For research and development in the field of rapid prototyping (RP) materials data about ageing behaviour and environmental effects are crucial. The authors show possible methods for measuring these effects and discuss the consequences in material research using a recently developed biocompatible SL resin as an example. Practical implications - The study of the ageing behaviour of polymers is important for understanding their usability, storage, lifetime and recycling. The presented polymeric formulations are able to meet the growing demand for both soft and stiff manufacturing resin materials in the engineering and medical fields. Originality/value - The analysis of the ageing behaviour of polymer materials is an important issue for engineering applications, recycling of post-consumer plastic waste, as well as the use of polymers as biological implants and matrices for drug delivery and the lifetime of an article. The paper gives an overview of details involving ageing behaviour and their meaning for applications of acrylate-based SL resins and is therefore of high importance to people with interest in long-term behaviour and ageing of RP materials},

The system incorporates 24 sensors measuring strain, 4 sensors measuring acceleration, a stand-alone data acquisition unit weighing 1.7kg which can be mounted behind the seat post and an offline programme analysing the data obtained. The system has been fully implemented on a BMX bicycle for the work presented herein. Piezo-electric accelerometers and resistance strain gauges are used as sensors which are wired to the data acquisition (DAQ) unit. The DAQ unit consists of a controller-chassis, 4 signal conditioning modules and specific application software. The software which controls the measurement process performs sensor calibration, simultaneous 24 bit data acquisition with a sampling frequency of 1000Hz, signal conditioning and data storage. The sampling frequency was established as optimal in specifically designed assessment tests. The data is post-processed to determine the frequency responses, maximum accelerations and strains and to illustrate the time behaviour of accelerations and strains. The measurement and analysis system is validated in common cycling scenarios and a race simulation on a race track. The system is applicable to different types of bicycles and enables comprehensive investigations of structural phenomena. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) have the potential to become a powerful political vision that can support the urgently needed global transition to a shared and lasting prosperity. In December 2014, the United Nations (UN) Secretary General published his report on the SDGs. However, the final goals and targets that will be adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2015 risk falling short of expectations because of what we call " cockpit-ism": the illusion that top-down steering by governments and intergovernmental organizations alone can address global problems. In view of the limited effectiveness of intergovernmental efforts and questions about the capacity of national governments to affect change, the SDGs need to additionally mobilize new agents of change such as businesses, cities and civil society. To galvanize such a broad set of actors, multiple perspectives on sustainable development are needed that respond to the various motives and logics of change of these different actors. We propose four connected perspectives which can strengthen the universal relevance of the SDGs: " planetary boundaries" to stress the urgency of addressing environmental concerns and to target governments to take responsibility for (global) public goods; " the safe and just operating space" to highlight the interconnectedness of social and environmental concerns and its distributive consequences; " the energetic society" to benefit from the willingness of a broad group of actors worldwide to take action; and " green competition" to stimulate innovation and new business practices. To realize the transformative potential of the SDGs, these four perspectives should be reflected in the focus and content of the SDGs that will be negotiated in the run up to September 2015 and its further implementation.},

abstract = {Technological Convergence (TC) reflects developmental processes that overlap different technological fields. It holds promise to yield outcomes that exceed the sum of its subparts. Measuring emergence for a TC environment can inform innovation management. This paper suggests a novel approach to identify Emergent Topics (ETopics) of the TC environment within a target technology domain using patent information. A non-TC environment is constructed as a comparison group. First, TC is operationalized as a co-classification of a given patent into multiple 4-digit IPC codes (≥2-IPC). We take a set of patents and parse those into three sub-datasets based on the number of IPC codes assigned 1-IPC (Non-TC), 2-IPC and ≥3-IPC. Second, a method is applied to identify emergent terms (ETs) and calculate emergence score for each term in each sub-dataset. Finally, we cluster those ETs using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to generate a factor map with ETopics. A convergent domain – 3D printing – is selected to present the illustrative results. Results affirm that for 3D printing, emergent topics in TC patents are distinctly different from those in non-TC patents. The number of ETs in the TC environment is increasing annually.},

Collaboration rooms, innovation centers, creativity labs - whatever the preferred terminology - are centers that can be relatively easy to set up and have enormous payoff.  The ability to effectively complete projects is a critical skill; and since most projects involve more than one person, the ability to collaborate successfully is a fundamental key to success.  Critical to creative collaboration are:  1.  acknowledging that everyone has ideas, 2.  developing a shared vision of a compelling challenge, 3.  having a rich flow of and easy access to information, 4.  creating trust, respect and participation.  There are some important fundamentals to keep in mind as you start to design a collaboration space:  1.  interaction, 2.  visual thinking, 3.  beauty, 4.  fun, 5.  abundance, and 6.  tools.

abstract = {Purpose – Recent developments in additive manufacturing (AM) technology have emphasized the issue of social impacts. However, such effects are still to be determined. So, the purpose of this paper is to map the social impacts of AM technology. Design/methodology/approach – The methodological approach applied in this study combines a literature review with computer-aided content analysis to search for keywords related to social impacts. The content analysis technique was used to identify and count the relevant keywords in academic documents associated with AM social impacts. Findings – The study found that AM technology social impacts are still in an exploratory phase. Evidence was found that several social challenges of AM technology will have an influence on the society. The topics associated with fabrication, customization, sustainability, business models and work emerged as the most relevant terms that can act as “pointers” to social impacts. Research limitations/implications – The research on this subject is strongly conditioned by the scarcity of empirical experience and, consequently, by the scarcity of data and publications on the topic. Originality/value – This study gives an up-to-date contribution to the topic of AM social impacts, which is still little explored in the literature. Moreover, the methodological approach used in this work combines bibliometrics with computer-aided content analysis, which also constitutes a contribution to support future literature reviews in any field. Overall, the results can be used to improve academic research in the topic and promote discussion among the different social actors},

Its relationships and implications to sustainable supply chains and the circular economy are still not well understood, even with initial investigations into the relationship. Emergy analysis can potentially provide additional profound opportunities to advancing these sustainability-oriented fields. Emergy analysis—as a basis for economic, social and environmental performance measurements—uses donor side valuation approaches. We discuss how sustainable supply chain management and circular economy performance measurement methods can be expanded and effectively utilize emergy analysis using a donor-side evaluation. We provide insights into more effective environmentally sustainable supply chain and circularity performance evaluation, accounting, and appraisal using emergy based performance measurements. Our findings show that there is ample room for further application and theoretical development at the nexus of these topics. Practically, the measures and approaches for emergy analysis can help decision makers in organizations and across supply chains in managing material sourcing, supplier selection, and network and circular economy flow designs. A theoretical synthesis and research gaps are introduced to help guide future theoretical developments and practical investigations. This work is valuable for those seeking to advance research on sustainability and performance analysis for organizational and supply chain levels of analysis.},

abstract = {Green supply chain management is attracting increasing attention as a way to decrease the adverse environmental effects of industries worldwide. However, considering the context of an emerging economy like Bangladesh, green supply chain management is still in its inception and has not been widely embraced in the textile industry, and therefore barriers hindering its adoption in emerging economy context demand a comprehensive investigation. This research reviews the viewpoints and hurdles in adopting green supply chain management practices in the context of the Bangladeshi textile industry. A questionnaire survey of Bangladeshi textile practitioners of operations and supply chain management division, having a sample size of thirty, was undertaken to identify the barriers, and a hierarchical cluster analysis technique was used in the detailed analysis of this data. Opinions were sought from experts on the significance of the resulting clusters, considering the relative importance of the barriers. Fifteen barriers to the adoption of green supply chain management were identified in the review of the literature, with these barriers then analyzed by using the data collected from Bangladeshi textile industry practitioners. The research indicates that the most important barrier is that there is low demand from customers and financial constraint resulting from short term little financial benefit to businesses, with lack of government regulations also a commonly faced barrier in adopting green supply chain initiatives. This study will provide valuables insights to practitioners and relevant policy makers about the barriers prevailing in the emerging economies towards the adoption of green supply chain management practices, which, in turn, can guide to undertake appropriate steps for alleviating those barriers.},

abstract = {As additive manufacturing (AM) is heading towards mass production and mass customization, the process needs to be environment-friendly and energy-efficient in order to be self-sustainable. Selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) are two processes contributing massively towards plastic additive manufacturing. In SLS, the powders that do not contribute to the mass of products become unusable (after some number of reuse) and finally turn into waste. As high energy is required for production of powders, generation of these wastes impacts environment sustainability. A contrivance needs to be developed to convert these waste powders into high-value products to make the process sustainable. FDM has the largest market share in terms of number of AM systems sold and is the most popular for fabricating low-value products. Its usefulness will be further expanded if inexpensive high-value products could be made through this process. In the present work, waste SLS powder is employed to prepare feedstock for inexpensive high-value FDM products, which demonstrates that SLS refuse could be utilized for mass production of FDM feedstock. If two processes (SLS {\&} FDM) will be connected as proposed here, it will make plastic additive manufacturing energy-efficient, self-sustainable, and will contribute to environment sustainability, in general.},

Although the notion has received increasing attention from scholars, practitioners and policy makers, its essence remains unclear to many. We therefore performed a systematic literature review of a sample of 114 scholarly articles about living labs to understand the central facets discussed in the nascent literature. In particular, we explored the origin of the living lab concept and its key paradigms and characteristics, including stakeholder roles, contexts, challenges, main outcomes, and sustainability. While doing this, we discovered that the number of publications about living labs has increased significantly since 2015, and several journals are very active in publishing articles on the topic. The living lab is considered a multidisciplinary phenomenon and it encompasses various research domains despite typically being discussed under open and user innovation paradigms. What is more, the existing literature views living labs simultaneously as landscapes, real-life environments, and methodologies, and it suggests that they include heterogeneous stakeholders and apply various business models, methods, tools and approaches. Finally, living labs face some challenges, such as temporality, governance, efficiency, user recruitment, sustainability, scalability and unpredictable outcomes. In contrast, the benefits include tangible and intangible innovation and a broader diversity of innovation. Based on our analysis, we provide some implications and suggestions for future research.},

In this paper, we document our experience and discuss our findings from a three-month project run in two high schools in Ioannina, Greece. 33 students were tasked to collaboratively design and produce, with the aid of an open source 3D printer and a 3D design platform, creative artifacts. Most of these artifacts carry messages in the Braille language. Our next goal, which defined this project's context, is to send the products to blind children inaugurating a novel way of communica- tion and collaboration amongst blind and non-blind students.

abstract = {SUMMARY The paper gives a state-of-the-art overview of so called rapid prototyping techniques, like stereolithography, selective laser sintering, ballistic particle manufacturing and others. These are new manufacturing techniques in which the part is produced by gradually growing material to the required shape. A tentative classification and nomenclature is proposed. It is shown that those new processes are ideally suited for CIM. The paper tries to compare the different processes and discuss their application and performances.},

abstract = {Principles and practices of open science at universities are evolving. Increasing use and application of digital technologies and platforms in research and innovation are pushing universities to take up and develop new visions and principles for how research and innovation are performed. These open science policies and practices (i.e. open data sharing, open access publishing, open repositories, open physical labs, participatory design, and transdisciplinary research platforms) are expanding the ethos of science and innovation at universities. These new principles and practices of open science at universities are also triggering novel open innovation practices by university research teams. Open science and innovation practices hold great potential for accelerating the learning and creation of new knowledge, speeding up the research and innovation process for finding solutions for grand societal challenges, and nurturing the growth of highly innovative and entrepreneurial people. The purpose of this study was to identify emergent principles, practices, and underlying mechanisms of open science and innovation developed and encountered by research teams at universities. The results of this study provide directions for how to advance openness in science at universities and illustrate how openness in innovation is being remodelled by open science practices. Based on our findings, we propose an open exploration policy and a governance model of open science and innovation at universities in the digital world, which aspire to create increased societal value.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of metal parts combined with part redesign has a positive repercussion on cost saving. In fact, a remarkable cost reduction can be obtained if the component shape is modified to exploit AM potentialities. This paper deals with the evaluation of the production volume for which AM techniques result competitive with respect to conventional processes for the production of end-usable metal parts. For this purpose, a comparison between two different technologies for metal part fabrication, the traditional high-pressure die-casting and the direct metal laser sintering additive technique, is done with consideration of both the geometric possibilities of AM and the economic point of view. A design for additive manufacturing approach is adopted. Costs models of both processes are identified and then applied to an aeronautical component selected as case study. This research evidences that currently additive techniques can be economically convenient and competitive to traditional processes for small to medium batch production of metal parts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and explore the validity of the Tutotest, the first standardized instrument designed to assess the skills and attitudes of medical students working in tutorials in a problem-based learning curriculum. METHOD: The Tutotest, consisting of 44 items rated on a four-point Likert-type scale, was developed from well-defined theoretical frameworks after consultation with students and teachers at the Universite de Sherbrooke Faculty of Medicine. In 1988-89, 40 tutors were asked to use the Tutotest to evaluate a total of 100 students at the end of each of the four units of the first-year curriculum. Data were analyzed to examine the homogeneity and reliability of the instrument, explore its factorial structure, and document its correlation with students' grades. RESULTS: A total of 28 tutors (70{\%}) conducted Tutotest evaluations; of a possible 400 evaluations, 270 (67.5{\%}) were returned with complete data. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that the Tutotest was structured around four factors that accounted for 82{\%} of the variance: effectiveness in the group (23 items), communication and leadership skills (13 items), scientific curiosity (four items), and respect for colleagues (four items). The Tutotest had a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .98 and a split-half coefficient of .98. The intraclass correlation coefficient was estimated to be .46 and would reach up to .81 after averaging five Tutotest evaluations. Tutotest scores showed good correlation (r = .64) with the official tutor's global evaluation and a moderate correlation (r = .39) with students' written examination results. CONCLUSION: The Tutotest was found to be a standardized reliable and valid instrument that can significantly improve the evaluation of students' skills and attitudes during tutorials. Although lengthier than the usual tutor evaluation form, the Tutotest is a good compromise between an unreliable short global scale and a more comprehensive but impractical instrument.},

abstract = {Different local governments engage in strategic interactions when they compete for resources to promote regional economic development under the background of ‘political tournaments'. Although many scholars have studied the impact of political competition among local governments on the environmental governance effect, they have paid less attention to the internal mechanism of the environmental benefits arising from political competition. Under the two scenarios of considering and not considering political competition, this paper uses Stackelberg game theory and optimization theory to analyse enterprises' optimal green technology innovation strategies. In addition, the impact of key factors is analysed based on the decision-making modes of cost-sharing and revenue-sharing, without cost-sharing and revenue-sharing, and centralized decision-making. This paper draws the following main conclusions: (1) Considering the influence of political competition, the optimal green technology innovation strategies of local governments and enterprises differ for different modes. (2) Political competition not only directly affects enterprises' optimal level of green technology innovation but also indirectly affects it by influencing the optimal investment ratio of environmental governance. The inverted U-shaped relationship between political competition and enterprises' optimal level of green technology innovation is related to the incentive coefficient of local government investment behaviour set by the central government. Controlling for the relative size of the incentive coefficient of local government investment in environmental governance and economic development can promote the positive impact of political competition on enterprises' optimal level of green technology innovation. (3) The decision-making mode of enterprises and local governments and environmental decentralization have significant effects on the optimal level of green technology innovation, which should be considered when the central government formulates effective environmental policies.},

abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to provide a review of available published literature in which nanostructures are incorporated into AM printing media as an attempt to improve the properties of the final printed part. The purpose of this article is to summarize the research done to date, to highlight successes in the field, and to identify opportunities that the union of AM and nanotechnology could bring to science and technology. Design/methodology/approach – Research in which metal, ceramic, and carbon nanomaterials have been incorporated into AM technologies such as stereolithography, laser sintering, fused filament fabrication, and three-dimensional printing is presented. The results of the addition of nanomaterials into these AM processes are reviewed. Findings – The addition of nanostructured materials into the printing media for additive manufacturing affects significantly the properties of the final parts. Challenges in the application of nanomaterials to additive manufacturing are nevertheless numerous. Research limitations/implications – Each of the AM methods described in this review has its own inherent limitations when nanoparticles are applied with the respective printing media. Overcoming these design boundaries may require the development of new instrumentation for successful AM with nanomaterials. Originality/value – This review shows that there are many opportunities in the marriage of AM and nanotechnology. Promising results have been published in the application of nanomaterials and AM, yet significant work remains to fully harness their inherent potential. This paper serves the purpose to researchers to explore new nanomaterials-based composites for additive manufacturing.},

abstract = {The open source introduction of fused filament fabrication (FFF) enables distributed manufacturing of consumer products. However, with a wide range of low-cost FFF 3-D printers and settings possible, there is a lack of information on the variability in printed mechanical properties. This paper utilizes a large pool of 47 user-assembled 3-D printers to quantify the mechanical property variations of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength of FFF printed components using ASTM D638-14 horizontally-oriented Type I and IV geometries for poly lactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that utilizing Type IV tensile test piece geometry may overestimate the UTS relative to the Type I. Furthermore, anisotropic mechanical property variances were quantified for Type IV specimens (vertical and horizontal orientations). Vertical tensile specimens had an ultimate tensile strength 47.9{\%} less than horizontal. Finally, the abundant supply of PLA 3-D prints suggest open-source printers assembled by individual operators can produce quality plastic components although the mechanical performance of the given part can vary dramatically based on the operator selection of printing parameters that provide a visually acceptable part.},

abstract = {Sustainability is and will be a crucial issue for the present and future generations. The current assumption that natural resources are infinite and that the regenerative capacity of the environment is able to compensate for all human action is no longer acceptable. Hence, sustainability issues will influence all organisational aspects of the human life, from the economical, political, social and environmental points of view. The reason is simple: until now, all human activities have been based on the paradigm of unlimited resources and unlimited world's capacity for regeneration; from now on, the awareness of the termination of this assumption means that all related behavioural models must be changed. This is a very impressive objective embracing all fields of culture, economy, technology and much more. A continuing effort, together with a reasonable time span, will be required to pursue this goal. Fortunately, nature and the environment are capable of self-regulation and will give man a chance to recover from the damage he is causing to the earth mother, provided that the will to do so is firmly established. Manufacturing, as the main pillar of the civilised lifestyle, will be strongly affected by the sustainability issues and it will play an important role in establishing a sustainable way ahead. Today, nearly all manufacturing models are based on the old paradigm. Technology, on which the manufacturing is largely based, is asked, together with culture and economy, to give the tools and options for building new solutions towards a sustainable manufacturing concept. Generally speaking, new technology, new business models and new lifestyle models will be the cornerstones of the new sustainable world and this will be particularly true for what concerns the manufacturing sector. Impressive constraints and requirements will affect the industrial sector on the way ahead towards sustainability. Research and development will play a crucial role to this concern, having the responsibility to offer appropriate options to the society for answering the above-mentioned needs. The main evidences on researches challenges expected for sustainable manufacturing are outlined by the authors that have been involved in the IMS international project 'IMS2020: Supporting Global Research for IMS2020 Vision', promoted by the European Commission to prepare a roadmap for future (2020) manufacturing research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {3D printing technology can produce complex objects directly from computer aided digital designs. The technology has traditionally been used by large companies to produce fit and form concept prototypes ('rapid prototyping') before production. In recent years however there has been a move to adopt the technology as full-scale manufacturing solution. The advent of low-cost, desktop 3D printers such as the RepRap and Fab@Home has meant a wider user base are now able to have access to desktop manufacturing platforms enabling them to produce highly customised products for personal use and sale. This uptake in usage has been coupled with a demand for printing technology and materials able to print functional elements such as electronic sensors. Here we present formulation of a simple conductive thermoplastic composite we term 'carbomorph' and demonstrate how it can be used in an unmodified low-cost 3D printer to print electronic sensors able to sense mechanical flexing and capacitance changes. We show how this capability can be used to produce custom sensing devices and user interface devices along with printed objects with embedded sensing capability. This advance in low-cost 3D printing with offer a new paradigm in the 3D printing field with printed sensors and electronics embedded inside 3D printed objects in a single build process without requiring complex or expensive materials incorporating additives such as carbon nanotubes.},

@article{Daly2016,
abstract = {In this study, we developed a spatially explicit model for nutrient uptake by root hairs based on X-ray computed tomography images of the rhizosphere soil structure. This work extends our previous work to larger domains and hence is valid for longer times. Unlike the model used previously, which considered only a small region of soil about the root, we considered an effectively infinite volume of bulk soil about the rhizosphere. We asked the question: At what distance away from root surfaces do the specific structural features of root-hair and soil aggregate morphology not matter because average properties start dominating the nutrient transport? The resulting model was used to capture bulk and rhizosphere soil properties by considering representative volumes of soil far from the root and adjacent to the root, respectively. By increasing the size of the volumes that we considered, the diffusive impedance of the bulk soil and root uptake were seen to converge. We did this for two different values of water content. We found that the size of region for which the nutrient uptake properties converged to a fixed value was dependent on the water saturation. In the fully saturated case, the region of soil we needed to consider was only of radius 1.1mm for poorly soil-mobile species such as phosphate. However, in the case of a partially saturated medium (relative saturation 0.3), we found that a radius of 1.4mm was necessary. This suggests that, in addition to the geometrical properties of the rhizosphere, there is an additional effect of soil moisture properties, which extends further from the root and may relate to other chemical changes in the rhizosphere. The latter were not explicitly included in our model.},

abstract = {This study presents an estimation of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) products put-on-market (PoM), electronic-waste (e-waste) generation and the stock of EEE products in Australia from the year 2000–2047, considering seven categories that encompass 51 different types of product. Holt's double-exponential smoothing and dynamic lifespans (using the Weibull distribution function) are applied to compute past and future PoM and in e-waste generation, respectively. With the estimation, it is found that EEE PoM was increased from 470 kilo tons (kt) to 2135 kt in a timeframe of 2000–2015. On the other hand, e-waste generation was 115 kt in the year 2000, which then increased to 485 kt in the year 2010. For the projected period (2018–2047), the annual average growth of e-waste generation will be around 3{\%}. E-waste generation will increase, particularly for large household appliances (LHA), small household appliances (SHA) and consumer equipment (CE), in terms of weight. This study evaluates the potentially recoverable material and revenue potential of regulated products (e.g., computer, televisions and other IT peripherals currently considered under the national television and computer recycling scheme (NTCRS) and mobile phones) and e-waste generated outside of the current product coverage. The gap between revenue generation from regulated and non-regulated products is quantitatively assessed for the first time and reported in this paper. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis performed by Monte Carlo simulation showed the robustness and accuracy of this study. This quantification will provide invaluable insights to policymakers, including products in future legislative reform as well as the development of the recycling industry in Australia. Furthermore, this study presents a transparent process of calculation for time-series data that can be used for e-waste generation estimation for other countries, as well.},

abstract = {This paper discusses an experimental evaluation of fine particle emissions (16.5–583 nm) released by a three-dimensional printer from various printing materials. Fine particle emissions were identified for a three-dimensional printer that uses fused deposition modelling technology. A method for evaluation of fine particle emissions from printing materials was developed. This method allowed us to test twelve commonly available printing materials. Size distributions of the produced fine particles and their concentrations were observed for each printing material during the printing periods. The count median diameter of emitted particles ranged from 26 to 56 nm. Particle number concentrations in a closed cover of a three-dimensional printer ranged from 103–106 particles/cm3, depending on the particular printing material. Tested printing materials were then subjected to thermogravimetric analysis. This analysis provides detailed information about the emission of fine particles and mass loss of a sample of the material depending on the current temperature of the printing material. The study presents information about differences between particular printing materials in terms of the amount of emitted fine particles as well as the particle size distribution of the amount over time. The study also suggests that thermogravimetric analysis of materials can be used for estimation of particle emission that will occur during the printing process that is based on fused deposition modelling.},

abstract = {The debate on the sustainability of service supply chain has recently become notorious with the increased environmental and economic impacts of service materiality. Cost-effective material management in the service domain has, therefore, become a competitive priority and a means for sustainability. This essentially requires the development of quantitative models with green options for optimizing material sourcing, transportation, inventory, processing, and reverse logistics. It is, however, a challenge to assess and integrate the economic and environmental costs of material procurement and consumption within service systems. The gap is more evident in service-only supply chains such as tourism, finance, and healthcare. Thus, this paper develops a service-oriented optimization model with green options for effective material management in a service environment. The developed model is focused on managing the material procurement and processing across the supply chain of a service firm (a hotel supply chain as an example). Mathematical formulation is first provided for a deterministic single-order model and this is then extended to a multi-period comprehensive material planning model. Proposed formulations are demonstrated through a simulated supply chain of accommodation services in a hotel. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed along with directions for future research. The value-added of this research is providing insight into material management across service supply chains, optimizing material assignment to offered services, and extending the impacts of green options to the whole supply chain of hotels and accommodation services.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society This work focuses on developing filaments of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and their hollow particle-filled syntactic foams for commercial three-dimensional (3D) printers based on fused filament fabrication technology. Hollow fly-ash cenospheres were blended by 40 wt.{\%} in a HDPE matrix to produce syntactic foam (HDPE40) filaments. Further, the recycling potential was studied by pelletizing the filaments again to extrude twice (2×) and three times (3×). The filaments were tensile tested at 10 −4 s −1 , 10 −3 s −1 , and 10 −2 s −1 strain rates. HDPE40 filaments show an increasing trend in modulus and strength with the strain rate. Higher density and modulus were noticed for 2× filaments compared to 1× filaments because of the crushing of some cenospheres in the extrusion cycle. However, 2× and 3× filament densities are nearly the same, showing potential for recycling them. The filaments show better properties than the same materials processed by conventional injection molding. Micro-CT scans show a uniform dispersion of cenospheres in all filaments.},

@article{Lazarevic2010,
abstract = {A number of life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have been undertaken within the last 15 years comparing end-of-life treatment options for post-consumer plastic waste, including techniques such as: mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling, incineration with energy recovery and landfilling. These have attempted to support decisions in the formulation of waste management strategies and policies. In light of the introduction of life cycle thinking into European waste policies, specifically in relation to the waste hierarchy, a literature review of publically available LCA studies evaluating alternative end-of-life treatment options for plastic waste has been conducted. This has been done in order to: establish if a consensus exists as to the environmentally preferable treatment option for plastic waste; identify the methodological considerations and assumptions that have led to these conclusions; and determine the legitimacy of applying the waste hierarchy to the plastic waste stream. The majority of the LCA studies concluded that, when single polymer plastic waste fractions with little organic contamination are recycled and replace virgin plastic at a ratio of close to 1:1, recycling is generally the environmentally preferred treatment option when compared to municipal solid waste incineration. It has been found that assumptions relating to the virgin material substitution ratio and level of organic contamination can have a significant influence upon the results of these studies. Although a limited number of studies addressed feedstock recycling, feedstock recycling and the use of plastic waste as a solid recovered fuel in cement kilns were preferred to municipal solid waste incineration. Landfilling of plastic waste compared to municipal solid waste incineration proved to be the least preferred option for all impact categories except for global warming potential. Due to the uncertainty surrounding some assumptions in the studies, it cannot be said with confidence that the waste hierarchy should be applied to plastic waste management as a general rule. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {Sorting at industrial scale is required to perform mechanical recycling of plastics in order to obtain properties that could be competitive with virgin polymers. As a matter of fact, the most part of the various types of plastic waste are not miscible and even compatible. Mid-Infrared (MIR) HyperSpectral Imagery (HSI) is viewed as one of the solutions to the problem of black plastic sorting. Many Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) plastics are black. Nowadays, these materials are difficult to sort at an industrial scale because the main used pigment to produce this color, carbon black, masks the Near-Infrared (NIR) spectra of polymers, the currently most used technology for acute sorting in industrial conditions. In this study, laboratory Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) in Attenuated Total Reflection mode (ATR) has been used as a theoretical toolbox based on physical chemistry to help building an automated HSI discrimination despite its limited conditions, especially shorter wavelengths ranges. Weaker resolution and very short acquisition times are other HSI limitations. Helping fast and exhaustive laboratory characterizations of polymeric waste stocks is the other goal of this study. This study focusses on polyolefins as they represent the second biggest fraction of WEEE plastics (WEEP) after styrenics and since little quantities mixed to styrenics during mechanical recycling can lead to important decrease in mechanical properties. Twelve references were thus evaluated and compared between each other and with real waste samples to highlight spectral elements, which can enable differentiation. Charts compiling the signals of discussed polymers were built aiming to the same objective.},

This paper deals with design for manufacturing (DFM) approach for additive manufacturing (AM) to investigate simultaneously the different attributes and criteria of design and manufacturing. The integrated design approach is provided in the product definition level and it gradually maps the customer requirements to the final product model. The main contribution of this paper is an interface processing engine that is an interface between the product model and manufacturing model. This study uses the Skin-Skeleton approach to model the first definition of the product and model the material flow of AM technology as the manufacturing process. This engine is developed through analysis of all AM technologies and identification of their parameters, criteria, and drawbacks. In order to evaluate some product and process parameters, a multi-objective problem is formulated based on the analysis of all AM technologies; production time and material mass are optimized regarding mechanical behavior of the material and roughness of product. The approach is validated by a case study through a bag hook example. From its requirement specification to the proposed approach, this article defines an optimized product and its manufacturing parameters for fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology.},

abstract = {While NASA explores the power of 3D printing in the development of the next generation space exploration vehicle, a CubeSat Trailblazer was launched in November 2013 that integrated 3D-printed structures with embedded electronics. Space provides a harsh environment necessary to demonstrate the durability of 3D-printed devices with radiation, extreme thermal cycling, and low pressure - all assaulting the structure at the atomic to macroscales. Consequently, devices that are operational in orbit can be relied upon in many terrestrial environments - including many defense and biomedical applications. The 3D-printed CubeSat module (a subsystem occupying approximately 10 {\%} of the total volume offered by the 10∈×∈10∈×∈10-cm CubeSat enclosure) has a substrate that fits specifically into the available volume - exploiting 3D printing to provide volumetric efficiency. Based on the best fabrication technology at the time for 3D-printed electronics, stereolithography (SL), a vat photopolymerization technology, was used to fabricate the dielectric structure, while conductive inks were dispensed in channels to provide the electrical interconnect between components. In spite of the structure passing qualification - including temperature cycling, shock and vibration, and outgas testing - the photocurable materials used in SL do not provide the level of durability required for long-term functionality. Moreover, the conductive inks with low-temperature curing capabilities as required by the SL substrate material are widely known to provide suboptimal performance in terms of conductivity. To address these challenges in future 3D-printed electronics, a next generation machine is under development and being referred to as the multi3D system, which denotes the use of multiple technologies to produce 3D, multi-material, multifunctional devices. Based on an extrusion process necessary to replace photocurable polymers with thermoplastics, a material extrusion system based on fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology has been developed that integrates other technologies to compensate for FDM's deficiencies in surface finish, minimum dimensional feature size, and porosity. Additionally, to minimize the use of conductive inks, a novel thermal embedding technology submerges copper wires into the thermoplastic dielectric structures during FDM process interruptions - providing high performance, robust interconnect, and ground planes - and serendipitously improving the mechanical properties of the structure. This paper compares and contrasts stereolithography used for 3D-printed electronics with the FDM-based system through experimental results and demonstrates an automated FDM-based process for producing features not achievable with FDM alone. In addition to the possibility of using direct write for electronic circuitry, the novel fabrication uses thermoplastics and copper wires that offer a substantial improvement in terms of performance and durability of 3D-printed electronics. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract = {Remanufacturing is a sustainable development strategy for recovering product value and extending original item lifetimes through collection, inspection, testing, and restoration activities. Remanufacturing activities are typically carried out on products that have been returned by consumers, and the increasingly high flow of products spontaneously returned by customers through marketing initiatives such as Money-Back Guarantee policies, false warranty claims, or end of life returns, is a growing source of products that can be easily remanufactured. In this paper, we develop a novel pricing model for a firm that produces and sells Generation 1 new products in the first period with a promise of Money-Back Guarantee on returned products regardless of reasons. Products returned in the first period can be remanufactured and sold as remanufactured products during the second period, alongside Generation 2 new products. The firm needs to determine the optimal pricing for its two generations of new products and its remanufactured products, based on demand derived from its customers' utility of purchasing either the new or the remanufactured products. We identify the firm's optimal production strategy. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the key managerial insights derived from the model. This paper makes two contributions to the literature: 1) it links customer returns and closed loop supply chain management. Most studies on customer returns do not link remanufacturing with product returns, while most studies on closed loop supply chains assume that the source for remanufactured products is unlimited. 2) It is shown that although remanufacturing returned products may cannibalize new sales, it enhances overall sales, as the firm can differentiate prices for Generation 2 new products and remanufactured products in the second period to attract customers with different valuations on the products.},

abstract = {Various authors have analyzed the fundamental barriers that hamper the transition towards a circular economy, e.g., economic and business, regulatory and legal, and social. This analysis questions how, under these constrained conditions, high-grade recycling can still be implemented successfully in the Netherlands. The study compares five Dutch material flows: paper and cardboard, plastics, non-wearable textiles, building and demolition waste and mattresses. It is concluded that the following four key conditions should be in place, but need a tailor-made approach for each material flow: (1) adequate collection system/logistics; (2) guaranteed volumes of material supply; (3) clear market demand for and (4) quality guarantee of recycled materials. Moreover, the following five key drivers help circumvent the fundamental barriers and realize the four key conditions: (1) mobilizing power by change agents; (2) cooperation within the material chain; (3) well-attuned financial arrangement; (4) circular procurement; and (5) technological innovation (including redesign). These drivers follow a certain sequence in implementation and circumvent the fundamental barriers each in their own way. This empirical analysis complements the mostly conceptual or theoretical literature on the transition towards high-grade recycling and the circular economy in general. Based on this analysis a conceptual model is developed, in which the key conditions, the key drivers and fundamental barriers are linked. Whether the results also hold true for other countries than the Netherlands needs additional research.},

In the past, researchers have highlighted numerous techniques to tackle physical waste, however the chemicals which are normally generated from this waste is more critical and limitedly reported. Zero Waste Manufacturing (ZWM) is believed as a roadmap for future of manufacturing by which the burning issue of “Waste” can be tackled. However, ZWM can be supported with recycling and reusability of the produced wastes in another manufacturing process, use of optimization tools and sustainable manufacturing theories, development of precision manufacturing systems, etc. This review article is taken up to discuss various recent sustainable manufacturing ideas applied in the prominent sectors with an aim to either re-cycle/re-use the discarded ones or to produce a fresh part in eco-friendly manners. Special attention is paid to the current trends in machining and a brief case study of sustainable manufacturing of aerospace industry has also been discussed.},

abstract = {With the increasingly serious problems of environmental impact and excessive consumption of production resources brought about by industrial development, enterprises pay more and more attention to the green manufacturing of industry. In the existing green manufacturing standard system, it clearly covers all elements, layers, activities and functions of green manufacturing. However, it does not refine the specific contents of green manufacturing model and framework in different industrial areas. The research in this paper can fill this gap. This paper aims to provide a general model and overall framework of green manufacturing for industrial enterprises. In this way, according to the needs and conditions, enterprises can construct and formulate a clear plan for the implementation of green manufacturing that conforms to their actual situation of enterprises. By these, it can ultimately enhance the improvement ratio of comprehensive green rate for enterprises. In this paper, a general reference model for green manufacturing based on IIPG (Industrial Implementation for Product life cycle based on Green index system) modular is proposed. Then, in the form of a case, three enterprises in three key industrial fields are selected to customize and validate the model. Integrating with intelligence technologies, such as artificial intelligence and industrial cloud, this model can be improved by the higher data processing efficiency and computing speed in green index systems, which is the follow-up work.},

abstract = {The theory of planned behavior (TPB) allows researchers to identify the determinants of environmental behavior and subsequently target these factors in interventions. Multiple studies on conservation behaviors have recently applied this theoretical framework in both organizational and domestic settings. To shed more light on how the TPB was used in these studies, we conducted a literature review with the following objectives: 1) explore which individual green behaviors were studied though the lens of the TPB, 2) understand how scholars have used the theory and what variance the theory has helped to explain, and 3) formulate recommendations, if necessary, for improving the use of the theory. The review of the results from 126 publications demonstrated that the majority of scholars tend to overlook the importance of identifying and evaluating indirect variables (beliefs) that affect behaviors. More than half of the analyzed articles did not report the amount of explained variance, which undermines the principal strength of the theory. Scholars could obtain more substantial and consistent results if the guidelines regarding the application of the theory are consistently respected. More specifically, four aspects should be considered in the application of the theory: choice of framework, decision to extend the original model, methodology, and results. To help scholars overcome these commonly encountered problems, this article suggests a roadmap with several guiding questions and possible answers.},

abstract = {What is the role of innovation policy for accomplishing renewal of mature industries in Western economies? Drawing upon an unusually rich dataset spanning 9752 digitized archival documents, we categorize and code decisions taken by policymakers on several levels while also mapping and quantifying the strategic activities of both entrant firms and incumbent monopolists over a decade. Our data concerns two empirical cases from Sweden during the time period 1980–1990: the financial sector and the telecommunications sector. In both industries, a combination of technological and institutional upheaval came into motion during this time period which in turn fueled the revitalization of the Swedish economy in the subsequent decades. Our findings show that Swedish policymakers in both cases consistently acted in order to promote the emergence of more competition and de novo entrant firms at the expense of established monopolies. The paper quantifies and documents this process while also highlighting several enabling conditions. In conclusion, the results indicate that successful innovation policy in mature economies is largely a matter of strategically dealing with resourceful vested interest groups, alignment of expectations, and removing resistance to industrial renewal.},

abstract = {This article presents a practical model for evaluating polymer feedstock materials as candidates for 3D printing across a variety of extrusion-based platforms. In order for a material to be successfully utilized for 3D printing operations, a series of fundamental conditions must be met. First, pressure-driven extrusion must occur through a given diameter nozzle at a specified flow rate. Second, the extruded material must form and sustain the desired shape. Third, the extruded structure must be able to bridge a specified gap and serve as a mechanically sound foundation for successive deposits. Finally, the deposited structure must be dimensionally stable during the transition to the final state (i.e. fully cured at room temperature). This article presents a framework for extrusion-based printing and a simple viscoelastic model for each of these conditions based on the rheological and thermo-physical properties of the candidate material and the processing parameters of the extrusion-based deposition platform. The model is demonstrated to be a useful tool for the evaluation of example test cases including: high temperature thermoplastics (polyphenylsulfone), fiber reinforced thermoplastics (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), low-viscosity thermosets (epoxy resins), and thermoplastics with a high coefficient of thermal expansion (polypropylene).},

abstract = {Since 1989, efforts to understand the nature of interfirm resource sharing in the form of industrial symbiosis and to replicate in a deliberate way what was largely self-organizing in Kalundborg, Denmark have followed many paths, some with much success and some with very little. This article provides a historical view of the motivations and means for pursuing industrial symbiosis - defined to include physical exchanges of materials, energy, water, and by-products among diversified clusters of firms. It finds that "uncovering" existing symbioses has led to more sustainable industrial development than attempts to design and build eco-industrial parks incorporating physical exchanges. By examining 15 proposed projects brought to national and international attention by the U.S. President's Council on Sustainable Development beginning in the early 1990s, and contrasting these with another 12 projects observed to share more elements of self-organization, recommendations are offered to stimulate the identification and uncovering of already existing "kernels" of symbiosis. In addition, policies and practices are suggested to identify early-stage precursors of potentially larger symbioses that can be nurtured and developed further. The article concludes that environmentally and economically desirable symbiotic exchanges are all around us and now we must shift our gaze to find and foster them. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University.},

However, the lack of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital costs and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized metal 3-D printers has severely restricted their deployment. The applications of commercialized metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive finished products. This severely restricts the access of the technology for small and medium enterprises, the developing world and for use in laboratories. This paper reports on the development of a {\textless}{\$}2000 open-source metal 3-D printer.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors led an action-research study for five years with several research and pedagogic projects, including users or citizens. Findings – The paper points out main factors of SC development. It also presents shared demonstrators' characteristics, including industrial scale, sustainability, and citizens' participation. Research limitations/implications – This research is experimented with only one regional multi-case study. Practical implications – Practical implications of this paper include a University of Lorraine diversification strategy through the “Chaire REVES” supported by public and private partners. Social implications – At the regional level, industrial-university-territorial partnerships could tackle both societal and economical issues “with,” “for,” and “by” citizens. Originality/value – Based on the Living Lab concept, this case study shows a concrete regional university strategy involving: user-centric design, collaborative processes, citizens' workshops, and new financial and organizational answers enabling collaboration between private companies and public institutions. The paper also argues that innovative PPPs involving users are necessary for developing SC. },

A standard part was designed and printed on each machine, and evaluated based on dimensional accuracy and surface finish. Additionally, the machines were compared based on build time for single and multiple parts as well as material consumption and unit cost. The research highlights the differences between AM units and suggests a method by which to ascertain the differences. With the rapid proliferation of desktop additive manufacturing units, a quantitative ranking system was developed to rate the units so a comparison can be made.

abstract = {This paper presents a brief description of some existing models of facility location problems (FLPs) in solid waste management. The study provides salient information on commonly used distance functions in location models along with their corresponding mathematical formulation. Some of the optimization techniques that have been applied to location problems are also presented along with an appropriate pseudocode algorithm for their implementation. Concerning the models and solution techniques, the survey concludes by summarizing some recent studies on the applications of FLPs to waste collection and disposal. It is expected that this paper will contribute in no small measure to an integrated solid waste management system with specific emphasis on issues associated with waste collection, thereby boosting the drive for effective and efficient waste collection systems. The content will also provide early career researchers with some necessary starting information required to formulate and solve problems relating to FLP.},

abstract = {The recovery of waste acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP) from waste white goods was inefficient due to their similar chemical and physical property. In this work, an environmental friendly equipment based on on-line dynamic recognition for recycling the waste white goods plastic stream (i.e. ABS, PS and PP mixture) was established. It included the recognition process utilizing the near infrared (NIR) range 1050 nm-1350 nm and separation process using the air ejection. In particular, NIR spectrum of waste plastic stream were acquired on-line and analyzed dynamically with the self-designed software. Results showed that although ABS, PS and PP share very similar chemical and physical property, it is possible to separate them with a high accuracy up to 99{\%}. Meanwhile, the optimized operating parameters of the separation process were studied to guide the further industrial recycling process. The study revealed the potentiality of NIR technique as mechanical methods in recycling of plastics from the waste white goods.},

abstract = {Recycling of polymers has come to be a necessary part of the development of a sustainable society. Recycling of low price bulk polymers, to which group the polyolefins belong, is seen by many as a waste of time and resources when they simply may be energy recovered. Several life-cycle assessments (LCA) have, however, proven that it is also valuable to material recycle bulk polymers such as polyolefins. In many instances, polyolefins are in-plant recycled and used again in similar products, but they may also be separated and sorted from municipal solid waste. This paper will discuss recycled polyolefins, in particular their change in material properties and how to characterise these properties and show that these analyses are a basis for quality determination. In fact, an important vehicle for the success of recycled polymeric materials is to use a quality concept. Accurate determination of a series of polymeric properties will be the only way recycled polymeric materials can compete with virgin ones. Analytical methods useful in the quality concept are presented and discussed. In particular, three parameters are important for quality measurements. These are degree of degradation, polymer composition and presence of low molecular weight compounds (degradation products of polymer matrix and additives, initiator/catalysts, solvents, use-related e.g. fragrance or flavour etc.). For the future it is important to give recycled polymeric materials status as resources besides the fossil and renewable ones.},

The present study has identified 29 enablers of sustainable manufacturing through literature review and opinions of experts. Interpretive Structural Modeling has been utilized to develop a hierarchy structural model which can represent the interrelationships among the enablers. The fuzzy concept has been integrated with Matrix Impact of Cross Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) technique to calculate the driving/dependence power of the enablers. The present study highlights “Limitation of traditional processes” and “Public pressure” as the most significant enablers for sustainable manufacturing adoption. The present study discusses a case application of identifying the interrelationships and influence of sustainable manufacturing enablers. The present study provides pivotal references for researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers by exploring the interrelationships and driving/dependence power of the enablers. The findings may encourage the researchers and practitioners to initiate the same studies in other manufacturing organizations by extending the set of enablers and classifying into some more realistic groups.},

We conducted a comparative case study of the aerospace industry in three European countries—France, Italy, and the United Kingdom (the U.K.)—that explores the governments' strategies to develop the emerging space industry. These strategies comprise a mix of innovation instruments, including the establishment of government agencies with the mission of supporting the space industry. The space agencies in each country had a common design that enabled the businesses to become global players in the industry. There is a link between the design of innovation policy mixes and the emerging model of European decentralized governance. This paper contributes to the literature by suggesting that government agencies are instruments of innovation policy for developing innovative industries.},

Using a multi-method approach and a New Zealand case study we illustrate the importance in housing studies, and research into homemaking in particular, of taking account of DIY practice. We emphasise that it is not possible for housing researchers to account fully for the role and function of DIY without interpreting it as a cultural and economic phenomenon. The ways people live in and make their houses demands a focus on DIY practices, identity, homeownership, government regulation and the globalising commercial features of DIY which include: international product manufacturing, big-box retailing, tool and materials distribution and advertising, the production of printed and digital instructional material, and new popular media forms, such as DIY reality television.

First, samples have been cycled until having an imposed deformation of 2.1, 4.8, 7.6 and 8.2{\%} till 50 cycles. Second, orthodontic specimens are submitted to cyclic loading with various strain rates of 5 × 10−3 s−1, 10−3 s−1, 5 × 10−4 s−1 and 10−4 s−1 under an imposed strain of 7.6{\%}. Finally, arch wires are charged by hydrogen in 0.9{\%} NaCl an aqueous solution at room temperature with a current density of 10 A/m2 for 2, 3, 4 and 6 h and are aged for 7 days in air. Throughout cyclic loading, a significant degradation of material performance is observed (the critical stress for the start and the end of the martensite transformation, the residual strain and the dissipated energy evolving). This evolution becomes more significant with a higher strain rate and with hydrogen charging rather then without it. Thus, via this work, we can assume that the embrittlement is due to the diffusion of hydrogen and the generation of dislocations after aging.},

Although over the past two decades several entities and groups of experts have demanded the development of specific standards for additive manufacturing, the most important steps forward have been taken in the last few years, mainly through the actions of international organizations such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), with the support of technical groups and projects focused on the standardization of AM. This work, which is successfully providing new standards for AM, is expected to be reinforced by a global agreement between ASTM and ISO with the aim of collaboration on common AM standards. This paper presents a summary and review of actions carried out so far by different organizations and projects, based on the work of several road maps and workshops, with the aim of developing new standards in this particular field.},

abstract = {The major challenges facing the 21st century world demands disruptive technology based solutions. One of the most promising exponential technology set to address world challenges is the Internet of Things (IoT) based Trillion Sensor System (TSS). The IoT supports many revolutionary commercial and societal solutions including wearable or unobtrusive medical sensors, Industry 4.0, power and water grids, smart cities, food production, education, transportation and roadway infrastructure needs. However, to support these solutions the current IoT infrastructure needs improved spectrum and the use of between one to ten Trillion Sensors (TS). The development of a robust IoT based TSS infrastructure would create an addition to world GDP equal to that of the U.S. GDP to double the worlds GDP. This new IoT based TSS would create a high paying job base that will form a new vibrant world middle class and an abundant economy. Yet while much is written about the ability of the IoT to transform society little effort is focused on its infrastructure. If this is true there is cause for concern. We add to the literature by developing a precursor road mapping construct which focuses on the service sector and supports 3rd generation road mapping techniques. We utilize the emerging IoT TSS technology base as our case study. We utilize the best thoughts of hundreds of experts from three organizations focused on accelerating IoT TSS road mapping efforts.},

abstract = {Flexibility in manufacturing operations is becoming increasingly important to industrial firms, due to e.g., increasing market demand volatility and shorter product life cycles. Additive manufacturing technologies show great potential in adding flexibility to manufacturing operations through nearly unlimited freedom in product design, very high product mix flexibility, decentralized production and the ability to produce new product variants after a very short period of time. This could result in shorter lead times, lower stock levels, higher product availability and lower transportation costs. Therefore companies have to incorporate the increased flexibility in their decision, especially on the production network level, when they decide whether to use additive manufacturing or not. Current methods are not able to take into account all of these flexibility types and the respective benefits. The application of an appropriate method could lead to a realistic evaluation and an increased use of additive manufacturing technologies. This paper evaluates state of the art methods, especially from the field of strategic production network planning. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a framework for integration of additive manufacturing technologies in production networks using the Real Option value as target criteria. Finally, we discuss where further research is needed in order to develop an applicable method based on the presented framework.},

abstract = {Incineration of plastic waste in an open field is a major source of air pollution. Most of the times, the Municipal Solid Waste containing about 12{\%} of plastics is burnt, releasing toxic gases like Dioxins, Furans, Mercury and Polychlorinated Biphenyls into the atmosphere. Further, burning of Poly Vinyl Chloride liberates hazardous halogens and pollutes air, the impact of which is climate change. The toxic substances thus released are posing a threat to vegetation, human and animal health and environment as a whole. Polystyrene is harmful to Central Nervous System. The hazardous brominated compounds act as carcinogens and mutagens. Dioxins settle on the crops and in our waterways where they eventually enter into our food and hence the body system. These Dioxins are the lethal persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and its worst component, 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), commonly known as agentorange is a toxic compound which causes cancer and neurological damage, disrupts reproductive thyroid and respiratory systems. Thus, burning of plastic wastes increase the risk of heart disease, aggravates respiratory ailments such as asthma and emphysema and cause rashes, nausea or headaches, and damages the nervous system. Hence, a sustainable step towards tomorrow's cleaner and healthier environment needs immediate attention of the environmentalists and scientists. This review presents the hazards of incineration; open burning of plastics and effects of plastic in water and also a possibility of working out strategies to develop alternate procedures of plastic waste management.},

abstract = {Experimental designs and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) play an important role when several and possibly conflicting responses have to be simultaneously optimized. This is the case for the development of a 3D printer prototype; specifically an interlocking device designed with two responses, max-load and mass, with different conflicting optimization goals. The purpose of this interlocking device is to serve as a possible means of recycling polyethylene terephthalate water bottles by repurposing them as prototype that can be fashioned into several new products or objects with different uses. Design of experiments is the initial step taken to identify and evaluate the best tradeoff between the responses; a Box Behnken design (BBD) is used to establish the experimental design. The applications of RSM with desirability functions are critical to find the perfect prototype with the adequate geometry to satisfy multiples needs. Results from the analysis reveals that diameter and depth were held constant in the majority of the solutions, however, thickness played an important role in the solution. The sensitivity analysis reports a maximum associated with a small percentage of change between the solutions provided by the different scenarios when different power values of desirability function were explored. The best interlocking device that provides a trade-off between mass minimization and max-load maximization is a design with a diameter of 0.92 inches, a depth of 0.041 inches and a thickness of 0.381 inches.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing with 3-D printers may be a key technology enabler for entrepreneurs seeking to use disruptive innovations such as business models utilizing distributed manufacturing. Unlike centralized manufacturing, distributed manufacturing makes the parts and products (the prints) at (or closer to) the source of the demand, cutting out much of the traditional supply chain. Although many expect 3-D printing to take off at the household level and previous work has shown significant returns for those choosing to do so, there are still significant barriers to entry for typical consumers. Our analysis demonstrates that for an individual to make an abnormally high return on their investments in 3-D printers, they must serve others to achieve high utilization rates. The impetus to do so is created by a service that can undercut traditionally manufactured products due to affordability and customizability. Low-cost, open-source 3-D printers are now priced within range of individual entrepreneurs who can take advantage of the long tail of consumers with highly varied interests. The margin advantage, net present value, and return on investment (ROI) analysis provided herein could form the basis of thousands of new small-business ventures in the coming years. {\textcopyright} 2015 Springer-Verlag London},

Collective intelligence was found to affect work process, operations, and service innovation. When corporate employees work in an environment where collective intelligence (CI) is highly developed, work procedures or efficiency may differ depending on the onset of CI. This raises the importance of CI within an organization and implies the importance of finding means to vitalize CI. This study provides significant implications for corporations utilizing collective intelligence services, such as online communities. Firstly, such corporations vitalize their services by raising the quality of information and knowledge shared in their workplaces; and secondly, contribution motivations that consider the characteristics of knowledge and information contributors require further development.},

Similar to the solutions proposed for other forms of ethical manufacturing, it is possible to consider a form of ethical 3-D printer filament distribution being developed. There is a market opportunity for producing this ethical 3-D printer filament, which is addressed in this paper by developing an “ethical product standard” for 3-D filament based upon a combination of existing fair-trade standards and technical and life cycle analysis of recycled filament production and 3-D printing manufacturing. These standards apply to businesses that can enable the economic development of waste pickers and include i) minimum pricing, ii) fair trade premium, iii) labor standards, iv) environmental and technical standards, v) health and safety standards, and vi) social standards including those that cover discrimination, harassment, freedom of association, collective bargaining and discipline.},

Conclusion:

Market opportunity for producing ethical 3D printer filament  from five converging trends:

1.  Market for 3D printers is expanding.

2.        Exponential growth in free open source designs.

3.        Commercial filament is being sold large markups
4.        Waste plastic extruders have been developed
5.        There is a growing concern and interest among consumers for ethically produced products.

abstract = {Large-scale globalised food manufacturing systems have generated competitive advantages through economies of scale. However, these systems often show low environmental sustainability and resilience due to factors such as reliance on global food supply-chain actors and high emissions associated to transportation and storage. This article proposes increasing the sustainability of food production through a transition towards a ‘Distributed Localised Manufacturing' (DLM) strategy. A novel assessment method is presented to evaluate the feasibility of DLM for different food products using nine distinctive metrics and a decision-support model to identify the most appropriate DLM system model for a specific scenario. An industrial case study is used to demonstrate the application of the novel assessment method. The results show that the DLM assessment method can accurately identify products that can benefit from the DLM strategy and potentially provide environmental and social benefits. In addition, the DLM assessment method demonstrated the ability to categorise key assessment criteria and support the selection of the most appropriate system model for a specific application. Finally, the method also provides guidelines to help to identify benefits, drivers and potential challenges that should be considered in future DLM implementations. In summary, this research presents a practical and powerful assessment method to support the implementation of a DLM strategy in the food-manufacturing sector in order to increase the long-term sustainability of food systems.},

abstract = {There is substantial difficulty with effectively, and meaningfully, engaging the public with community-based sustainability projects as a method to facilitate sustainable lifestyles. Individuals engage with community projects in numerous ways: cognitively (knowledge), affectively (emotions), and behaviourally (actions). One prevalent consideration that individuals consider is other peoples' (lack of) engagement; given that the success of community-based approaches addressing climate change is dependent upon the actions, and participation, of all local residents. Findings from focus groups in seven urban communities in the UK are presented that illustrate clear elements of ‘Othering' as part of individual engagements with community-based sustainability projects. Primarily, there is substantial consideration towards what other people within the community know, feel, and do to engage with community-based projects. Residents distinguish themselves in opposition to those they view as engaging, and not engaging, in the same way as themselves and indicate the need for equitable participation amongst all residents. These considerations have the potential to project particular barriers on wider community engagement if left to develop, cause tension, and are not resolved. Implications for participatory strategies to meaningfully and effectively engage individuals with community-based sustainability and transformational change are outlined. Insights into how considerations of ‘Othering' can be overcome so as not to cause negative engagements with other residents and attempts to live sustainably as part of a community approach are illustrated.},

abstract = {Sustainability in additive manufacturing refers mainly to the recycling rate of polymers and composites used in fused filament fabrication (FFF), which nowadays are rapidly increasing in volume and value. Recycling of such materials is mostly a thermomechanical process that modifies their overall mechanical behavior. The present research work focuses on the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymer, which is the second most popular material used in FFF-3D printing. In order to investigate the effect of the recycling courses on the mechanical response of the ABS polymer, an experimental simulation of the recycling process that isolates the thermomechanical treatment from other parameters (i.e., contamination, ageing, etc.) has been performed. To quantify the effect of repeated recycling processes on the mechanic response of the ABS polymer, a wide variety of mechanical tests were conducted on FFF-printed specimens. Regarding this, standard tensile, compression, flexion, impact and micro-hardness tests were performed per recycle repetition. The findings prove that the mechanical response of the recycled ABS polymer is generally improved over the recycling repetitions for a certain number of repetitions. An optimum overall mechanical behavior is found between the third and the fifth repetition, indicating a significant positive impact of the ABS polymer recycling, besides the environmental one.},

abstract = {Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has become the most favourable packaging material world-wide for beverages. The reason for this development is the excellent material properties of the PET material, especially its unbreakability and the very low weight of the bottles compared to glass bottles of the same filling volume. Nowadays, PET bottles are used for softdrinks, mineral water, energy drinks, ice teas as well as for more sensitive beverages like beer, wine and juices. For a long time, however, a bottle-to-bottle recycling of post-consumer PET packaging materials was not possible, because of the lack of knowledge about contamination of packaging polymers during first use or recollection. In addition, the decontamination efficiencies of recycling processes were in most cases unknown. During the last 20 years, PET recollection as well as recycling processes made a huge progress. Today, sophisticated decontamination processes, so-called super-clean recycling processes, are available for PET, which are able to decontaminate post-consumer contaminants to concentration levels of virgin PET materials. In the 1991, the first food contact approval of post-consumer PET in direct food contact applications has been given for post-consumer recycled PET in the USA. Now, 20 years after the first food approval of a PET super-clean recycling process, this article gives an overview over the world-wide progress of the bottle-to-bottle recycling of PET beverage bottles, e.g. the recollection amount of post-consumer PET bottles and the super-clean recycling technologies. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Bone drilling simulators with virtual and haptic feedback provide a safe, cost-effective and repeatable alternative to traditional surgical training methods. To develop such a simulator, accurate haptic rendering based on a force model is required to feedback bone drilling forces based on user input. Current predictive bone drilling force models based on bovine bones with various drilling conditions and parameters are not representative of the bone drilling process in bone surgery. The objective of this study was to provide a bone drilling force model for haptic rendering based on calibration and validation experiments in fresh cadaveric bones with different bone densities. METHODS: Using a commonly used drill bit geometry (2 mm diameter), feed rates (20-60 mm/min) and spindle speeds (4000-6000 rpm) in orthognathic surgeries, the bone drilling forces of specimens from two groups were measured and the calibration coefficients of the specific normal and frictional pressures were determined. RESULTS: The comparison of the predicted forces and the measured forces from validation experiments with a large range of feed rates and spindle speeds demonstrates that the proposed bone drilling forces can predict the trends and average forces well. CONCLUSION: The presented bone drilling force model can be used for haptic rendering in surgical simulators.},

Under a scenario where there is a global shift towards the circular economy, this paper discusses the advent of two parallel and yet-to-be-connected trends for Australia, namely: (i) responsible minerals supply chains and (ii) additive manufacturing, also known as 3D production systems. Acknowledging the current context for waste management, the paper explores future interlinked questions which arise in the circular economy for responsible supply chains, additive manufacturing, and metals recycling. For example, where do mined and recycled resources fit in responsible supply chains as inputs to responsible production? What is required to ensure 3D production systems are resource efficient? How could more distributed models of production, enabled by additive manufacturing, change the geographical scale at which it is economic or desirable to close the loop? Examples are given to highlight the need for an integrated research agenda to address these questions and to foster Australian opportunities in the circular economy.},

abstract = {Technical specifications appropriate for the recycling of agricultural plastic wastes (APWs), widely accepted by the recycling industry were developed. The specifications establish quality standards to be met by the agricultural plastics producers, users and the agricultural plastic waste management chain. They constitute the base for the best economical and environmental valorisation of the APW. The analysis of the APW streams conducted across Europe in the framework of the European project ". LabelAgriWaste" revealed the inherent characteristics of the APW streams and the inherent constraints (technical or economical) of the APW. The APW stream properties related to its recycling potential and measured during pilot trials are presented and a subsequent universally accepted simplified and expanded list of APW recycling technical specifications is proposed and justified. The list includes two sets of specifications, applied to two different quality categories of recyclable APW: one for pellet production process ("Quality I") and another one for plastic profile production process ("Quality II"). Parameters that are taken into consideration in the specifications include the APW physical characteristics, contamination, composition and degradation. The proposed specifications are focused on polyethylene based APW that represents the vast majority of the APW stream. However, the specifications can be adjusted to cover also APW of different materials (e.g. PP or PVC) that are found in very small quantities in protected cultivations in Europe. The adoption of the proposed specifications could transform this waste stream into a labelled commodity traded freely in the market and will constitute the base for the best economical and environmental valorisation of the APW. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) has been rapidly developing over the last decade. It shows great potential in reducing the need for energy- and resource-intensive manufacturing processes, which in turn reduces the amount of material required in the supply chain, and enables more environmentally benign practices. However, the question of how to realize these potential benefits has received little attention. This paper aims to provide an overview of the Sustainability of Additive Manufacturing (SAM). The context of the SAM is introduced, with a focus on energy and environmental impacts. Resource consumption is identified as the most important aspect. Examination from a life cycle perspective is also presented, with explicit discussions on opportunities to reduce energy and material consumption through design, material preparation, manufacturing, usage, and end-of-life treatment. Statistical data analysis provides an overview of impact forecasts, highlighting the importance of and need for thorough research on sustainability. The eco-design concept enabled by AM is identified as the most promising and effective technology, further extending and completing its design capability. This also determines the opportunities for energy and environmental optimization in subsequent processes. Most existing research is in process- and system-specific modeling, and few AM processes and systems have been studied, with generally premature conclusions. General models for each type of AM process are still necessary. Lastly, five research priorities are suggested: improve systematic data integration and management, correlate energy and quality, develop intelligent machinery, focus on material preparation and recycling, and discover innovative applications using AM.},

abstract = {As-cast, porous surfaced CoCr implants were tested for bone interfacial shear strength in a canine transcortical model. Three-dimensional printing (3DP) was used to create complex molds with a dimensional resolution of 175 mum 3DP is a solid freeform fabrication technique that can generate ceramic pieces by printing binder onto a bed of ceramic powder. A printhead is rastered across the powder, building a monolithic mold, layer by layer. Using these 3DP molds, surfaces can be textured "as-cast," eliminating the need for additional processing as with commercially available sintered beads or wire mesh surfaces. Three experimental textures were fabricated, each consisting of a surface layer and deep layer with distinct individual porosities. The surface layer ranged from a porosity of 38{\%} (Surface Y) to 67{\%} (Surface Z), whereas the deep layer ranged from 39{\%} (Surface Z) to 63{\%} (Surface Y). An intermediate texture was fabricated that consisted of 43{\%} porosity in both surface and deep layers (Surface X). Control surfaces were commercial sintered beaded coatings with a nominal porosity of 37{\%}. A well-documented canine transcortical implant model was utilized to evaluate these experimental surfaces. In this model, five cylindrical implants were placed in transverse bicortical defects in each femur of purpose bred coon-hounds. A Latin Square technique was used to randomize the experimental implants left to right and proximal to distal within a given animal and among animals. Each experimental site was paired with a porous coated control site located at the same level in the contralateral limb. Thus, for each of the three time periods (6, 12, and 26 weeks) five dogs were utilized, yielding a total of 24 experimental sites and 24 matched pair control sites. At each time period, mechanical push-out tests were used to evaluate interfacial shear strength. Other specimens were subjected to histomorphometric analysis. Macrotexture Z, with the highest surface porosity, failed at a significantly higher shear stress (p = 0.05) than the porous coated controls at 26 weeks. It is postulated that an increased volume of ingrown bone, resulting from a combination of high surface porosity and a high percentage of ingrowth, was responsible for the observed improvement in strength. Macrotextures X and Y also had significantly greater bone ingrowth than the controls (p = 0.05 at 26 weeks), and displayed, on average, greater interfacial shear strengths than controls, although they were not statistically significant.

To ensure the development of additive manufacturing processes it seems important to develop the concept of DFSAM (Design for Sustainable Additive Manufacturing).

To achieve this goal, it is interesting to get a predictive model of consumptions, integrated in the design step, allowing to evaluate the product's environmental impact during the manufacturing step. This paper presents a new methodology for electric, fluids and raw material consumptions assessment for additive manufacturing processes, in particular for a direct metal deposition process. The methodology will help engineers to design parts optimized for additive manufacturing with an environmental point of view.},

The severity of the extreme weather changes has urged the weather and climate to be an integral part of mainstream education. However, the aim of the contemporary climate change education in cultivating behavioral change is in vain. This is because the physiological concerns that explain the behavior were ignored in designing the curriculum. This notion has prompted the researcher to determine the relationship between values, belief, personal norms, and climate change behaviors and subsequently model the climate conservation behaviors. For this purpose, a survey questionnaire was administered to 300 Year 5 and Year 6 primary school students. The questionnaire consisted of items measured on values, belief, personal norms, and climate conserving behaviors. The data was then analyzed using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation approach. The findings revealed that there were significant positive relationships between values and belief; values and personal norms; values and behavior; belief and personal norms; belief and behaviors; and personal norms and behaviors. The Goodness of Fit index indicated that the overall model has excellent exploratory power in comparison to the baseline values. The model offers a guide in designing climate change curriculum and training the teachers in teaching about climate change in primary schools.},

abstract = {Metamaterials exhibit properties beyond those exhibited by conventional materials in conventional scenarios. These have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally at length. In many cases the underpinning physical understanding of metamaterials has greatly preceded our ability to manufacture constituent structures. However, the development of additive manufacturing techniques gives new possibilities for the fabrication of complex metamaterial structures, many of which cannot be realised through conventional fabrication methods. The literature to date contains contributions from a diverse group of researchers from the physical sciences, mathematics, and manufacturing technology in the creation of metamaterials for electromagnetic, acoustic and mechanical applications. It is proposed that additive manufacturing holds the key to realise the capabilities of this vibrant research community and permit the creation of new paradigms in fundamental structures but also exploitation through application. For this purpose, a literature review is presented which identifies key advances in metamaterials alongside additive manufacturing and proposes new opportunities for researchers to work together through intra/inter disciplinary research to realise structures which exhibit extraordinary behaviour(s). This review represents a comprehensive account of the state-of-the-art in the production of such metamaterials using additive manufacturing methods and highlights areas, which, based on trends observed in the literature, are worthy of further research and require a coordinated effort on behalf of the afore mentioned disciplines in order to advance the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Sustainability and Industrial Ecology (IE) are the main drivers of industrial symbiosis (InSys) and eco-industrial parks (EIPs). InSys, therefore, extends the idea of industrial ecology (IE) to the industrial sector by adopting a resource-efficient approach where one firm uses the unused or residual resources (materials, energy, water, assets, logistics, and expertise) of another firm. The aim is to enhance a sustainable and cleaner production in an environmentally friendly way, one in which generation of wastes and emission of greenhouse gases (including CO 2) is minimized. Although previous literatures have investigated existing InSys tools, the utilization of the process integration (PI) tools for InSys design and planning has mostly operated in isolation of each other and thus concentrated on individual resources which makes the it hard for InSys designers to select the best tools. Furthermore, there is a dearth in research on comprehensive and integrated resource optimization, which considers the integration of all resources (such as energy, water, power, carbon and wastes) within InSys simultaneously. Therefore, this study investigated and surveyed available literatures in order to identify and develop a more comprehensive description of InSys tools, through the analysis of related methodologies and applications by integration of various resources optimization tools together for the design and establishment of EIPs. The tools are inclusive of both insight-based Pinch Analysis and mathematical optimization models approaches. The review also conducted a bibliometric analysis of some keywords using Scopus over a span of twenty-two years (1998e2019). Through the insights and understanding gained from the review, designers will be more equipped to make a more informed choice of working tools to utilize. Finally, suggestions were offered on some tools that will enhance the integration of eco-industrial parks to minimize fresh water/wastewater, minimize fuel use and reduce GHGs emissions and the minimization of cooling, heating and power requirements in Total Sites. The review of integrated resource optimization tools is then followed by identifying future research directions and development.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing is a technology rapidly expanding on a number of industrial sectors. It provides design freedom and environmental/ecological advantages. It transforms essentially design files to fully functional products. However, it is still hampered by low productivity, poor quality and uncertainty of final part mechanical properties. The root cause of undesired effects lies in the control aspects of the process. Optimization is difficult due to limited modelling approaches. Physical phenomena associated with additive manufacturing processes are complex, including melting/ solidification and vaporization, heat and mass transfer etc. The goal of the current study is to map available additive manufacturing methods based on their process mechanisms, review modelling approaches based on modelling methods and identify research gaps. Later sections of the study review implications for closed-loop control of the process.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is expected to impart profound changes to the configuration of manufacturing companies with regards to what their value proposition will be and how their production network, supplier base and customer interfaces will develop. The literature on the topic is still fragmented; the features of the emerging paradigm appear to be a contested territory among different academic disciplines. This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the experts' comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0. Managers and policymakers can leverage the scenarios in long-term strategic planning.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies have been successfully applied in various applications. Fused deposition modeling (FDM), one of the most popular AM techniques, is the most widely used method for fabricating thermoplastic parts those are mainly used as rapid prototypes for functional testing with advantages of low cost, minimal wastage, and ease of material change. Due to the intrinsically limited mechanical properties of pure thermoplastic materials, there is a critical need to improve mechanical properties for FDM-fabricated pure thermoplastic parts. One of the possible methods is adding reinforced materials (such as carbon fibers) into plastic materials to form thermoplastic matrix carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites those could be directly used in the actual application areas, such as aerospace, automotive, and wind energy. This paper is going to present FDM of thermoplastic matrix CFRP composites and test if adding carbon fiber (different content and length) can improve the mechanical properties of FDM-fabricated parts. The CFRP feedstock filaments were fabricated from plastic pellets and carbon fiber powders for FDM process. After FDM fabrication, effects on the tensile properties (including tensile strength, Young's modulus, toughness, yield strength, and ductility) and flexural properties (including flexural stress, flexural modulus, flexural toughness, and flexural yield strength) of specimens were experimentally investigated. In order to explore the parts fracture reasons during tensile and flexural tests, fracture interface of CFRP composite specimens after tensile testing and flexural testing was observed and analyzed using SEM micrograph.},

abstract = {Upon stimulation with agonists, platelets express CD40 ligand (CD40L), a transmembrane protein implicated in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic disease. We have recently discovered that oxidative stress plays a major role in platelet CD40L expression. In this study, we sought to determine whether vitamin C, a known antioxidant, is able to influence platelet CD40L expression. In vitro experiments were done by stimulating platelets with collagen in the presence or absence of vitamin C (50-100 $\mu$M) or vehicle as control. An in vivo study was done in 10 healthy subjects who were randomized to intravenous infusion of placebo or 1 g vitamin C for 45 min in a crossover design. At the end of infusion platelet CD40L and O2- were measured. The in vitro study demonstrated that vitamin C dose dependently inhibited platelet CD40L expression without affecting agonist-induced platelet aggregation. In subjects treated with placebo no changes of platelet CD40L and O2- were observed; conversely, vitamin C infusion caused a significant and parallel decrease of platelet O2- (-70{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001) and CD40L (-68{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001). Platelet aggregation was not modified by either treatment. This study suggests that water-soluble antioxidants, which scavenge superoxide radicals, may reduce platelet CD40L expression. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Climate change is real and its impacts are mostly negative, but common portrayals of devastation are unfounded. Scenarios set out under the UN Climate Panel (IPCC) show human welfare will likely increase to 450{\%} of today's welfare over the 21st century. Climate damages will reduce this welfare increase to 434{\%}. Arguments for devastation typically claim that extreme weather (like droughts, floods, wildfires, and hurricanes) is already worsening because of climate change. This is mostly misleading and inconsistent with the IPCC literature. For instance, the IPCC finds no trend for global hurricane frequency and has low confidence in attribution of changes to human activity, while the US has not seen an increase in landfalling hurricanes since 1900. Global death risk from extreme weather has declined 99{\%} over 100 years and global costs have declined 26{\%} over the last 28 years. Arguments for devastation typically ignore adaptation, which will reduce vulnerability dramatically. While climate research suggests that fewer but stronger future hurricanes will increase damages, this effect will be countered by richer and more resilient societies. Global cost of hurricanes will likely decline from 0.04{\%} of GDP today to 0.02{\%} in 2100. Climate-economic research shows that the total cost from untreated climate change is negative but moderate, likely equivalent to a 3.6{\%} reduction in total GDP. Climate policies also have costs that often vastly outweigh their climate benefits. The Paris Agreement, if fully implemented, will cost {\$}819–{\$}1,890 billion per year in 2030, yet will reduce emissions by just 1{\%} of what is needed to limit average global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Each dollar spent on Paris will likely produce climate benefits worth 11¢. Long-term impacts of climate policy can cost even more. The IPCC's two best future scenarios are the “sustainable” SSP1 and the “fossil-fuel driven” SSP5. Current climate-focused attitudes suggest we aim for the “sustainable” world, but the higher economic growth in SSP5 actually leads to much greater welfare for humanity. After adjusting for climate damages, SSP5 will on average leave grandchildren of today's poor {\$}48,000 better off every year. It will reduce poverty by 26 million each year until 2050, inequality will be lower, and more than 80 million premature deaths will be avoided. Using carbon taxes, an optimal realistic climate policy can aggressively reduce emissions and reduce the global temperature increase from 4.1°C in 2100 to 3.75°C. This will cost {\$}18 trillion, but deliver climate benefits worth twice that. The popular 2°C target, in contrast, is unrealistic and would leave the world more than {\$}250 trillion worse off. The most effective climate policy is increasing investment in green R=D to make future decarbonization much cheaper. This can deliver {\$}11 of climate benefits for each dollar spent. More effective climate policies can help the world do better. The current climate discourse leads to wasteful climate policies, diverting attention and funds from more effective ways to improve the world.},

Existing courses on design, engineering and management related to production and manufacturing do not systematically deliver the necessary skills and knowledge for an effective deployment of AM technologies. Based on a literature review and evidence collected from multi-stakeholder workshops, this paper presents the key themes for education programmes to address the current skill gap and barriers to AM adoption and exploitation.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Through an approximate solution of the energy balance, we develop a model to correlate the dimensionless fiber feed velocity (represented by a P{\'{e}}clet number) with a dimensionless temperature. Using these dimensionless parameters, all polymers fall onto the same curve. However, when molten polymer is forced through a small nozzle to enable 3D printing, this curve also depends on another parameter: Nozzle diameter. Our model does not account for this parameter because it does not consider hydrodynamics due to the complexity of the coupled energy and momentum balances. Thus, we modify the P{\'{e}}clet number to account for hydrodynamics and produce a satisfactory master curve for all diameters and polymers.

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

abstract = {This paper contains an analysis of Industrial symbiosis policies to explore how development Industrial symbiosis systems is influenced by policies and to examine how future policy frameworks can designed to best support the development of Industrial symbiosis systems. Industrial symbiosis is in the paper defined as the connection of traditionally separate industries in a collective effort to simultaneously increase competitive advantage and reduce environmental impacts by means of byproduct exchange and shared infrastructure. The paper is based on three components: First, the paper reviews, journal articles to provide a policy landscape overview of how such Industrial symbiosis systems are supported by policies and in which areas new policy needs can be identified. Secondly, the paper reviews and discusses policies and framework conditions, provided by the European Union (EU), the United Nations (UN) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) designed to support the development of Industrial symbiosis systems The analysis distinguishes between direct and indirect policies in order to emphasize that the development of Industrial symbiosis systems is influenced not only by policies directly targeting industrial symbiosis but also by general framework conditions that may not have been designed with Industrials symbiosis in mind. To improve the understanding of such in direct policies the paper thirdly includes a case study from Denmark, Maabjerg Energy Center (MEC). This case provides new insights into the application of Industrial symbiosis concepts, especially with regards to how framework conditions and indirect policies can influence and shape the development of industrial symbiosis systems. Based on these three components, this paper analyses obstacles and drivers for a further dissemination of Industrial symbiosis within the EU, and suggest key points for further assessment and development on a potential way forward. From the literature review and framework conditions assessed, general recommendations are provided whereof many relate to the potential benefits of focusing more on development and redevelopment of indirect incentive schemes fostering symbiotic behavior in industries as opposed to focusing only on designing policies exclusively based on direct top-down regulations. From the case analysis, several examples of more context-specific drivers and obstacles were highlighted as valuable in the given situation including the potential benefit of more flexible funding schemes, the importance of positive value-based communication to gain political support on the local, regional and national environment, feed-in tariffs and tax reliefs and the relevance of having centralized legal organs with specialized competencies on regional or national level to support development and implementation efforts.},

In this paper, we shed light on this interplay, and explore the activities of civic energy communities as configurational user innovations, i.e. creating user-designed arrangements of loosely related sets of components. Our analysis shows that configurational work combines off-the-shelf technologies with novel technical and non-technical ideas, such as business models for local energy provision, rather than endeavor clear-cut changes to existing devices. Such configurational work is deeply entangled with learning processes at the community level, whereby an evolving technical identity as well as various community building activities provide a growing network of resources as necessary context for implementation of user innovations.},

abstract = {The distance of recycling bins from households is often considered important by practitioners, but published evidence for this uses only indirect and self-reported data. This study aims to provide such evidence by obtaining a clean test using measured distances in a walled community with 1200 households with the same building types, local governance, recycling and waste arrangements. The number of deposits each month of food waste for recycling at a designated site are logged via smart-cards allocated per household. The number of days per month that each household deposits showed a highly significant - but small - negative correlation with distance of the bin: fewer householders participate if further away, accounting for 3{\%} of the variation. Surprisingly, there is no variation with distance among those who do participate: their recycling frequency does not vary. This second result is not consistent with the first in terms of cost/benefit concepts assumed by government planners, nor with the static theories of behaviour currently used in waste management research. We recommend that recycling practitioners note the smallness of the contribution of distance to recycling performance, and not overrate it. And we recommend that researchers make better use of non-static models (which model different stages towards behaviour change), which our second result appears to call for.},

Material change is often regarded as ‘damage' or ‘degradation' and contributes to premature obsolescence but has potential to be used as a tool to engender emotional engagement with an object and extend product lifetimes. However, materials resources for designers rarely provide information about how materials will change in use. In this paper we draw on a combination of literature and user studies to elucidate the complex web of factors which contribute to changes in material surfaces, which we present in a ‘framework for understanding material change'. We go on to explore the role that changes to product material surfaces, and the design of objects to change in particular ways with use, could have on the transition to circular modes of consumption. A range of resources which aim to increase designers' understanding of material change are presented, and the challenges of creating, utilising and developing these resources are discussed.},

abstract = {The rapid technical evolution of additive manufacturing (AM) enables a new path to a circular economy using distributed recycling and production. This concept of Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is related to the use of recycled materials by means of mechanical recycling process in the 3D printing process chain. This paper aims to examine the current advances on thermoplastic recycling processes via additive manufacturing technologies. After proposing a closed recycling global chain for DRAM, a systematic literature review including 92 papers from 2009 to 2019 was performed using the scopus, web of science and springer databases. This work examines main topics from six stages (recovery, preparation, compounding, feedstock, printing, quality) of the proposed DRAM chain. The results suggested that few works have been done for the recovery and preparation stages, while a great progress has already been done for the other stages in order to validate the technical feasibility, environmental impact, and economic viability. Potential research paths in the pre-treatment of recycled material at local level and printing chain phases were identified in order to connect the development of DRAM with the circular economy ambition at micro, meso and macro level. The development of each stage proposed using the open source approach is a relevant path to scale DRAM to reach the full technical potential as a centerpiece of the circular economy.},

abstract = {This paper assesses possible futures concerning so-called 3D printing in rela- tion to socio-technical systems and consumption and production. Drawing on an Economic and Social Research Council funded project, the paper details the results of research explor- ing possible futures of the manufacturing industry and impacts upon the transport of objects. Such ‘printing',or ‘personal fabrication', could permit many objects to be produced near to or even by consumers themselves on just-in-time ‘printing' machines. Widely known about in engineering and design, the impacts of these technologies on social practices and transport have yet to be much examined by social science. These technologies may become as ubiqui- tous as networked computers, with consequences just as significant. The paper reports on this recent research that seeks to understand some economic, social and environmental implications of what may be a major new socio-technical system currently in the making and which might have major consequences for the trajectory of the twenty-first century},

@article{Ghobadian2018,
abstract = {In response to hypercompetition, globalisation and increasing consumer expectations, many manufacturing firms have embraced lean manufacturing (LM). The primary goal of LM is to reduce/eliminate waste (muda). There is broad consensus as to what constitutes waste, but not on LM implementation. Implementation is not prescriptive with each firm relying on a different combination of administrative, process and routine change / innovation. Lean manufacturing brings about incremental change relying on administrative, process and routine levers. It best fits mass production where process variability is low and demand is high and stable. Lean manufacturing can significantly reduce waste but not eliminate waste, and the attained benefits have not always lived up to expectations. Additive manufacturing (AM) promises to revolutionise manufacturing beyond recognition by eliminating or drastically removing the waste thereby achieving sustainability. But AM is at its formative stage – the space between the concept and growth - where many promising breakthrough technologies fail. To reach its full potential, it needs to achieve high-scale adoption. In this paper, we examine how AM can significantly reduce/eliminate waste and how it can deliver triple bottom line on an unprecedented scale. We contend that AM, if adopted deeply and widely, will take LM to its final frontier, but there are a number of impediments to this end. We identify legitimation as critical to its wide diffusion and develop a number of propositions expediting AM's legitimation. Legitimation of AM will ensure its deep and broad diffusion and should this happen, waste will be a thing of the past an important stride towards sustainable future.},

The tensile strength, failure strain, Poisson's ratio, coefficient of thermal expansion and modulus were all shown to vary significantly depending on the build orientation of identical dogbones. FDM parts ranged in strength from 46 to 85{\%} of strengths attainable from comparable injection-molded parts. The coefficient of variation (CV) increased from 2 to 13{\%} as the primary layer orientation deviated from the primary load direction. CAT scan and SEM were employed to relate the corresponding macrostructure to the mechanical response of the material along the parts??? 3-primary directions, using digital image correlation (DIC). The fracture surfaces of these parts further suggest that 3D FDM materials behave more like laminated composite structures than isotropic cast resins and therefore design allowables should reflect actual part build configurations.},

abstract = {Until now, studies of the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) market have been confined to advanced market economies, with developing countries ignored. This article begins to bridge this gap. Analysing a survey of 500 households in India, a developing country characterized by cheap and surplus labour, and a different cultural milieu, this article investigates whether it is possible to distinguish DIY consumers in the same manner as in Western nations as 'reluctant' or 'willing' DIYers. The analysis finds that in India, DIY consumers can be concurrently both willing DIYers doing so for pleasure (the choice model) or seeking selfidentity from the end-product (post-modern theory) and at the same time reluctant DIYers doing so out of economic necessity reasons (economic determinism model) or due to the lack of appropriately skilled labour (a market failure model). Results also reflected cultural connotations to the respondent perceptions. The multiplicity of reasons, in consequence, shows that no one theorisation of DIY consumers' motives is universally relevant but all theories are sometimes valid. As such, a new typology of DIY consumers' motives has been inductively generated which is theoretically integrative. The results conclude on the need to move beyond using one theory and treating the others as rival competing theories, for a comprehensive explanation of DIY. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {The economic philosophy of abundance has provided a new portal to view disruptive innovation. After decades of the world's middle class shrinking and the poor becoming poorer the abundance concept has created an interest in the “Rising Billion” transforming the poor into a more viable economic force and grow a worldwide vibrant middle class throughout the developed, developing and underdeveloped world. The abundance concept provides a new set of potential problems that are spurring new opportunities. The 21st century grand challenges have been enumerated by many but include at least six key basic human necessities: healthcare; water, education; food generation, energy, and the environment. The key to “Abundance” is to better understand the disruptive innovation phenomena, and how it can be used for social change. Scholars have utilized different perspectives to explain innovation phenomenon, but literature on disruptive innovation can benefit from a coherent theoretical framework that can explain origins of disruptive innovation and the role of scarcity/abundance in that process. In this paper, we provide one such theoretical framework to better explain and understand the relationship among scarcity, abundance, and innovation concepts from a market perspective. More specifically, this paper address the need to understand how radical or disruptive innovations occur to create a more abundant world and what market conditions motivates innovators, especially in communities enduring poverty and scarcity of resources such as the “Bottom Billion” and the shrinking middle class to do so. We build a theoretical model of disruptive innovation in a resource-constrained environment by integrating arguments from the theory of social capital, disruptive innovation and entrepreneurial action, and social innovation.},

abstract = {Three Dimensional Printing is a process for creating parts directly from a computer model. 3D Printing builds parts in layers by spreading a layer of powder and then selectively joining the powder in the layer by ink-jet printing of a binder material. After all layers are printed, the layer loose of powder is removed to reveal the finished part. Application areas include ceramic molds for metal castings, directly printed parts for end-use and for use as tooling, ceramic preforms for metal matrix composites, structural ceramic parts, and others. 3D Printing is a member of a group of layer manufacturing techniques which have the primary distinguishing feature of creating parts by the controlled addition (rather than subtraction) of material. The primitive building element in 3D Printing is a spherical ensemble of powder particles held together by one droplet of binder. Ballistic effects are important in the formation of primitives due to kinetic energy associated with the incoming droplet. Stitching together of droplets forms surfaces and hence determines surface finish. Vertical dimensional control is determined in pan by the compression of powder layers by subsequently applied powder. These physical mechanisms help to determine the dimensional control and surface finish of 3D Printed parts. ?? 1993 CIRP.},

However, much of this information appears scattered throughout a disciplinary academic literature, unpublished government agency reports, and across the World Wide Web. In addition, data on ecosystem goods and services often appears at incompatible scales of analysis and is classified differently by different authors. In order to make comparative ecological economic analysis possible, a standardized framework for the comprehensive assessment of ecosystem functions, goods and services is needed. In response to this challenge, this paper presents a conceptual framework and typology for describing, classifying and valuing ecosystem functions, goods and services in a clear and consistent manner. In the following analysis, a classification is given for the fullest possible range of 23 ecosystem functions that provide a much larger number of goods and services. In the second part of the paper, a checklist and matrix is provided, linking these ecosystem functions to the main ecological, socio-cultural and economic valuation methods. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This paper contains an analysis of Industrial symbiosis policies to explore how development Industrial symbiosis systems is influenced by policies and to examine how future policy frameworks can designed to best support the development of Industrial symbiosis systems. Industrial symbiosis is in the paper defined as the connection of traditionally separate industries in a collective effort to simultaneously increase competitive advantage and reduce environmental impacts by means of byproduct exchange and shared infrastructure. The paper is based on three components: First, the paper reviews, journal articles to provide a policy landscape overview of how such Industrial symbiosis systems are supported by policies and in which areas new policy needs can be identified. Secondly, the paper reviews and discusses policies and framework conditions, provided by the European Union (EU), the United Nations (UN) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) designed to support the development of Industrial symbiosis systems The analysis distinguishes between direct and indirect policies in order to emphasize that the development of Industrial symbiosis systems is influenced not only by policies directly targeting industrial symbiosis but also by general framework conditions that may not have been designed with Industrials symbiosis in mind. To improve the understanding of such in direct policies the paper thirdly includes a case study from Denmark, Maabjerg Energy Center (MEC). This case provides new insights into the application of Industrial symbiosis concepts, especially with regards to how framework conditions and indirect policies can influence and shape the development of industrial symbiosis systems. Based on these three components, this paper analyses obstacles and drivers for a further dissemination of Industrial symbiosis within the EU, and suggest key points for further assessment and development on a potential way forward. From the literature review and framework conditions assessed, general recommendations are provided whereof many relate to the potential benefits of focusing more on development and re-development of indirect incentive schemes fostering symbiotic behavior in industries as opposed to focusing only on designing policies exclusively based on direct top-down regulations. From the case analysis, several examples of more context-specific drivers and obstacles were highlighted as valuable in the given situation including the potential benefit of more flexible funding schemes, the importance of positive value-based communication to gain political support on the local, regional and national environment, feed-in tariffs and tax reliefs and the relevance of having centralized legal organs with specialized competencies on regional or national level to support development and implementation efforts.},

Powder chemistries and solid build chemistries are also examined and shown to be constant for up to 40 cycles of powder reuse, but there was a 10-15{\%} reduction in Al content in the solid builds at optimised build conditions. Quality control and related issues are also described using duplicate products for destructive testing correlated with removable quality control tabs on the builds.},

abstract = {The lack of specific standards for characterization of materials manufactured by Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) makes the assessment of the applicability of the test methods available and the analysis of their limitations necessary; depending on the definition of the most appropriate specimens on the kind of part we want to produce or the purpose of the data we want to obtain from the tests. In this work, the Spanish standard UNE 116005:2012 and international standard ASTM D638–14:2014 have been used to characterize mechanically FDM samples with solid infill considering two build orientations. Tests performed according to the specific standard for additive manufacturing UNE 116005:2012 present a much better repeatability than the ones according to the general test standard ASTM D638–14, which makes the standard UNE more appropriate for comparison of different materials. Orientation on-edge provides higher strength to the parts obtained by FDM, which is coherent with the arrangement of the filaments in each layer for each orientation. Comparison with non-solid specimens shows that the increase of strength due to the infill is not in the same proportion to the percentage of infill. The values of strain to break for the samples with solid infill presents a much higher deformation before fracture.},

abstract = {Amazon was the world's top Research and Development (R{\&}D) firm in 2017. Its R{\&}D investment was double that of 2015, five times that of 2012, and ten times that of 2011. Such a rapid and notable increase in R{\&}D investment has raised the question of a new R{\&}D definition and focus in the digital economy, which Amazon insists includes both “routine or periodic alterations” (traditionally classified as non-R{\&}D) and “significant improvement” (classified as R{\&}D). Using an empirical analysis of Amazon's R{\&}D model as a system, this paper attempts to provide a convincing answer to this question. It has been identified that Amazon, which is based on R{\&}D as a culture, has been promoting companywide experimentation to cause customers obsessed with making purchase decisions. This obsession has enabled Amazon to deploy an architecture for participation that makes the most of digital technologies by harnessing the power of users. Such user-driven innovation has accelerated a dramatic advancement of the Internet that, in turn, has accelerated the co-emergence of soft innovation resources in the marketplace. This emergence has activated a self-propagating function that has induced functionality development, leading to supra-functionality beyond an economic value that satisfies a shift in customers' preferences. While this system depends on the assimilation capacity of soft innovation resources, Amazon has developed a high level of capacity supported by a rapid and notable increase in R{\&}D investment. The above efforts function in a virtuous cycle leading to the transformation of “routine or periodic alterations” into “significant improvement.” These findings give rise to insightful suggestions regarding a new concept of R{\&}D in neo open innovation in the digital economy.},

abstract = {Industrial regions, specialized in heavy industry, currently face many challenges, due to their strong specialization (job losses, closure of plants, etc.) and are looking for new paths of diversification. Industrial ecology can be an engine of this diversification: the industrial symbiosis generated by its implementation is a source of positive externalities stemming from the articulation of geographical, organizational, and cognitive proximities. These externalities strengthen territorial attractiveness and favor the development of a related variety. Using a mixed methodology including the constitution and analysis of database and interviews, we study the case of Dunkirk, pioneer city in France for the implementation of industrial ecology. The empirical results show that the new companies are linked to local ones through eco-industrial synergies. These synergies can be, through the flows of information and knowledge, a source of the emergence of new markets and innovative technologies and thus induce territorial development.},

abstract = {Innovation, a broad social and economic activity within emerging societies, transcends any specific technology, even if revolutionary, and is tied to attitudes and behaviours oriented towards the exploitation of change by adding value. In this context, we analyse on-going paths towards innovative societies taking into consideration their sustainable development. The solution-space for innovation for sustainability is characterised by three dimensions: 1) the entire lifespan of a product; 2) the entire socio-technic network of which a particular plant is part of, or from which a particular product emerges; and 3) stakeholders and decision processes, including business organisations and strategies; and public institutions, policy and regulatory frameworks. All theses three dimensions are shown to be critically related with the social appropriation of a broad knowledge base, which calls our special attention to the systems of innovation and competence building shaping our societies. Societies and their organisations differ in their approach to sustainability. Distinguishing between different types of stakeholders helps to elucidate barriers to change, and to exploit the solution-space for innovation. The contributions in this Special Issue illustrate various dimensions of the innovation-space and their related knowledge base. The examples addressed support the conclusion that the framework presented has general applicability to analyse and foster innovation for sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This research work highlights the thermomechanical investigations of silicon carbide (SiC) and aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 )–reinforced high-density polyethylene (HDPE)–based feed stock filament of commercial fused deposition modeling (FDM) setup. The recycled HDPE waste was collected (from domestic waste) and washed with water jet for removal of contamination in the first stage. After contamination removal, rheological and thermal behavior (melt flow index, melting temperature, decomposition and enthalpy, etc.) of the unreinforced and reinforced polymer matrix was observed. The SiC and Al 2 O 3 reinforcements in the HDPE matrix have been controlled by twin-screw extrusion process, followed by its processing on single-screw extrusion for preparation of FDM feed stock filament. The feed stock filament prepared by single-screw extruder was subjected to tensile test for mechanical properties (such as peak strength, peak load, and Young's modulus). After ascertaining mechanical properties, multifactor optimization has been performed. Finally, scanning electron micrographs were obtained to understand the distribution of ceramic particles. This study highlights the detailed procedure for managing the polymer waste with improved mechanical properties by considering multifactor optimization. This will enhance the sustainability and also helps to develop low-cost, in-house FDM filament for possible applications as rapid tooling.},

abstract = {An "open science movement" is gaining traction across many disciplines within the research enterprise but is also precipitating consternation among those who worry that too much disruption may be hampering professional productivity. Despite this disruption, proponents of open data collaboration have argued that some of the biggest problems of the 21st century need to be solved with the help of many people and that data sharing will be the necessary engine to make that happen. In the United States, a national strategic plan for data sharing encouraged the federally funded scientific agencies to (a) publish open data for community use in discoverable, machinereadable, and useful ways; (b) work with public and civil society organizations to set priorities for data to be shared; (c) support innovation and feedback on open data solutions; and (d) continue efforts to release and enhance high-priority data sets funded by taxpayer dollars. One of the more visible open data projects in the psychological sciences is the presidentially announced "Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies" (BRAIN) initiative. Lessons learned from initiatives such as these are instructive both from the perspective of open science within psychology and from the perspective of understanding the psychology of open science. Recommendations for creating better pathways to "walk the walk" in open science include (a) nurturing innovation and agile learning, (b) thinking outside the paradigm, (c) creating simplicity from complexity, and (d) participating in continuous learning evidence platforms.},

The analysis is based on an in-depth case-study analysis on the use of Open Data and the ‘hackathon' format within the Ghent Living Lab (Ghent, Belgium). The analytical framework focusses on the innovation ecosystem, urban transitions, user innovation, civic engagement, public and economic value creation and sustainability issues. Our findings explore the nature of the interactions and the outcomes of the projects. While hackathon events within an Urban Living Lab have already proven some of their potential, several opportunities remain. Especially the lack of involvement of private partners and a rather low focus on potential business models for the projects forecloses long-term sustainability and economic value creation. Central governance, focus on follow-up processes and a rigid innovation development framework are needed to overcome these challenges.},

Inevitably, conventional Design Theory and Methodology (DTM) especially life-cycle objectives oriented ones are challenged. In this paper, firstly, the impact of AM on conventional DTM is analyzed in terms of design for manufacturing (DFM), design for assembly (DFA), and design for performance (DFP). Abundance of evidences indicate that conventional DTM is not qualified to embrace these new opportunities and consequently underline the need for a set of design principles for AM to achieve a better design. Secondly, design methods related with AM are reviewed and classified into three main groups, including design guidelines, modified DTM for AM, and design for additive manufacturing (DFAM). The principles and representative design methods in each category are studied comprehensively with respect to benefits and drawbacks. A new design method partially overcoming these drawbacks by integrating function integration and structure optimization to realize less part count and better performance is discussed. Design tools as a necessary part for supporting design are also studied. In the meantime, the review also identified the possible areas for future research.},

For the bibliometric part, numerous trends like publication trend, authors and geographical cooperation and prominent keywords are presented using the VOSviewer software. For the second intention, the scope and features of inherent assessments methods for sustainable process design are discussed in addition to the historical development of these methods. The techniques are categorized among seven groups based on the method adopted for inherent assessment along with the benefits and detriments of each group. It is revealed that initially, the inherent assessment has focused on the comparison of various process routes, whereas, the modern methods intend to minimize the risk. Furthermore, it is recognized that the process equipment approach is not much explored yet, which may improve the sustainable process designing via the equipment characteristics. Finally, the limitations of present schemes and future research directions for inherent assessment implications in the sustainable process design are also highlighted, such that the objectives of economic, healthier, safer and environmental-friendly process plants can be materialized.},

The focus is on developing processes of collaborative design and experimentation through material engagement with technology and issues of concern.

abstract = {Although the environmental benefits of recycling plastics are well established and most geographic locations within the U.S. offer some plastic recycling, recycling rates are often low. Low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants due to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight polymers. The recycling rates decline further when low population density, rural and relatively isolated communities are investigated because of the distance to recycling centers makes recycling difficult and both economically and energetically inefficient. The recent development of a class of open source hardware tools (e.g. RecycleBots) able to convert post-consumer plastic waste to polymer filament for 3-D printing offer a means to increase recycling rates by enabling distributed recycling. In addition, to reducing the amount of plastic disposed of in landfills, distributed recycling may also provide low-income families a means to supplement their income with domestic production of small plastic goods. This study investigates the environmental impacts of polymer recycling. A life-cycle analysis (LCA) for centralized plastic recycling is compared to the implementation of distributed recycling in rural areas. Environmental impact of both recycling scenarios is quantified in terms of energy use per unit mass of recycled plastic. A sensitivity analysis is used to determine the environmental impacts of both systems as a function of distance to recycling centers. The results of this LCA study indicate that distributed recycling of HDPE for rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes. This study indicates that the technical progress in solar photovoltaic devices, open-source 3-D printing and polymer filament extrusion have made distributed polymer recycling and upcycling technically viable.},

abstract = {Three dimensional printing has gained consid- erable interest lately due to the proliferation of inexpensive devices as well as open source software that drive those devices. Public interest is often followed by media cover- age that tends to sensationalize technology. Based on popu- lar articles, the public may create the impression that 3D printing is the Holy Grail; we are going to print everything as one piece, traditional manufacturing is at the brink of collapse, and exotic applications, such as cloning a human body by 3D bio-printing, are just around the corner. The purpose of this paper is to paint a more realistic picture by identifying ten challenges that clearly illustrate the limita- tions of this technology, which makes it just as vulnerable as anything else that had been touted before as the next game changer.},

Meanwhile, the emergent socio-ecological crisis is making it increasingly important to identify the impact of business on environment and the society. To date, much literature has explored how sustainability might be achieved through firms' internal research and development, and supply chain collaboration. However, issues such as how different stakeholders including customers, partners, government, and universities can be involved, forming innovation ecosystem in a sustainable way is under-explored. This paper aims to provide connection between innovation and sustainability, through literature review and exploratory case studies. A conceptual framework is generated starting from firm/intra-firm level, to supply chain/inter-firm level, and towards ecosystem level. With emerging themes of innovation from sustainability perspective proposed, the framework can be enriched and validated through future empirical studies.},

abstract = {Social entrepreneurship is recognized as a key tool for overcoming social problems in society and supporting sustainable development. While social entrepreneurship is not a new phenomenon, the field has experienced significant growth over the past 15 years, either when applied to social problem-solving in a traditional way, or focused on private-sector entrepreneurship and large-scale transformation. However, there is still a lack of scientific review papers examining various government regulatory mechanisms, implemented on different government levels for stimulating social entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship ecosystems. This study aims to analyze the state-of-the-art of social entrepreneurship and its relation with government and key non-state actors. Following Pittaway et al. (2014) and Cerchione et al. (2018), a systematic literature review was carried out using the Scopus database, covering the period from 2001 up to 20th of March 2018, which resulted in a corpus of 478 scientific articles. The papers were ranked by the number of citations, according to the Web of Science{\textregistered} database, from which were selected the 102 most representative works. The abstracts of these selected studies were organized and submitted into an analysis of content via the 2015 edition of Alceste{\textregistered} software. Following the reading of all sources, the papers were classified and a matrix of data was produced, which allowed the descriptive analysis. The results show that there are at least six levels of government intervention to facilitate the development of social entrepreneurship. It also identified 4 directions taken by the government in support of social entrepreneurship, and 11 regulatory mechanisms, both of which could be deepened in future studies. The role of key non-state actors in the social entrepreneurship field has also been discussed. Based on the study, a future research agenda on the topic has been defined in the following directions: (i) a combination and coordination of regulatory mechanisms for better stimulation of social entrepreneurship, (ii) government policy oriented to the whole social entrepreneurship ecosystem, (iii) social capital, (iv) business models for social entrepreneurship ecosystems and government support.},

However, in achieving circularity, obstacles need to be overcome and new business models need to be developed. One of these business models is Waste Valorisation. Waste Valorisation focuses on the transformation of alleged waste, by-products or residue into valuable material. This paper aims to establish the current view on Waste Valorisation models and explore any influential factors within this circular business model through the lens of social capital theory. The findings are based on a focus group discussion with academics, practitioners, and policy makers. Results indicate, collaborative aspects aid to create value within this specific business model, as well as technology can act as a facilitator for collaboration between stakeholders in realizing the benefits of Waste Valorisation model. Based on the findings, a theoretical framework was developed which can be used as a guide to develop further research on Waste Valorisation.},

abstract = {The paper studies the effects of competition on innovation in various technology groups of mature Russian manufacturing firms. The purpose of the research is to establish whether more intense competition is good or bad for innovation, and to learn how the response to competition varies between technology leaders, followers and laggards. The study uses the 2014 survey data, which includes 1920 manufacturing firms from 19 sectors and size groups between 10 and 10,000 employees. The finding is that commitment to product innovation increases with competition at a modest level of competitive pressure, especially if foreign entry and import are considered. However, this result is mostly driven by technologically weak plants, which innovate less than leaders and followers at a low level of competition, but are encouraged to innovate more by a modest increase of competitive pressure, when theoretically predicted optimal behavior would be to refrain from innovation. When competition is strong, plants in all technology groups give up the innovation race. Competition is less influential in explaining process (as opposed to product) innovation, and the findings demonstrate a clear inverted U-shaped link: laggards and leaders are more likely to upgrade process technologies when weak competition increases slightly, and are less likely to do so when strong competition becomes stronger.},

Material and method 3 groups of participants: novices (n = 8), intermediaries (n = 14) and experts (n = 7) were enrolled in the study. They had to perform different types of odontological suture. We used 2 wireless wrist sensors to measure objectively the acceleration of both hands and to deduce the economy and the fluidity of the movement. A video recording was also used to complete the assessment. Results The time and motion criteria were documented to significantly correlate with the experience of the participant. The total time factor has a significant effect with the experience level (p = 0.006). The fluidity of the movement has also been shown to vary significantly between groups. Conclusion The use of accelerometers coupled with image analysis could make it possible to envisage in the long run an objective evaluation for this type of surgical gesture.},

abstract = {As the number of prosumer printers has expanded rapidly, they now make up the majority of the 3-D printer market and of these printers those in the open-source lineage of the RepRap also have expanded to dominate. Although still primarily used for prototyping or hobbyist production of low-value products, the RepRap has the capacity to be used for high-value distributed manufacturing. A recent study found that RepRap printed parts printed in realistic environmental conditions can match and even out perform commercial 3-D printers using proprietary FDM in terms of tensile strength with the same polymers. However, tensile strengths of the large sample set of RepRap prints fluctuated. In order to explain that fluctuation and better inform designers on RepRap print properties this study determines the effect of color and processing temperature on material properties of Lulzbot TAZ deposited PLA in various colors. Five colors (white, black, blue, gray, and natural) of commercially available filament processed from 4043D PLA is tested for crystallinity with XRD, tensile strength following ASTM D638 and the microstructure is evaluated with environmental scanning electron microscope. Results are presented showing a strong relationship between tensile strength and percent crystallinity of a 3-D printed sample and a strong relationship between percent crystallinity and the extruder temperature. Conclusions are drawn about the effects of color and processing temperature on the material properties of 3-D printed PLA to promote the open-source development of RepRap 3-D printing.},

abstract = {This paper details the investigation of an emerging trend within technology development: open design. Improvements in communications and computing technology have made collaboration over geographically vast distances possible. This technology has already had a major impact on the field of engineering, from the development of CAD/CAE/CAM practices to the emergence of concurrent engineering. Taking the lead from open source software, open design is an approach to technology development in which technical design information is licensed in such a manner that it can be accessed, utilised, modified and redistributed by anyone. The potential implications of this concept can be inferred from the impact of open source software. A review of the existing literature on the subject was conducted. A practical demonstration of the process was undertaken, via an attempt to contribute to an existing open design technology: the RepRap. This is a low cost rapid prototyper capable of manufacturing the parts required to make a copy of itself. The ability to use resin as a construction material was identified as a requirement of the device. An approach to integrating resin extrusion within the device was selected, a suitable material identified, and an experimental rig designed and assembled. Initial test results indicated that resin extrusion is viable for the RepRap.},

Paraphrasing Schumpeter, who explained innovation as a ‘new combination of production factors', social innovation can be defined as a new combination of social practices. To add an empirical dimension, via qualitative research we have explored the expectations and values of makers. We chose to proceed from the concrete to the abstract by approaching 30 Makers with very specific issues they knew from their day-to-day work and asked them regarding their social ambitions in terms of inclusion, education and environmentalism.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychomotor testing has been recently incorporated into residency training programs not only to objectively assess a surgeon's abilities but also to address current patient-safety advocacy and medicolegal trends. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a cost-effective psychomotor training and assessment tool-The Fundamentals of Orthopaedic Surgery (FORS)-for junior-level orthopaedic surgery resident education. METHODS: An orthopaedic skills board was made from supplies purchased at a local hardware store with a total cost of less than {\$}350 so as to assess six different psychomotor skills. The six skills included fracture reduction, three-dimensional drill accuracy, simulated fluoroscopy-guided drill accuracy, depth-of-plunge minimization, drill-by-feel accuracy, and suture speed and quality. Medical students, residents, and attending physicians from three orthopaedic surgery residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education participated in the study. Twenty-five medical students were retained for longitudinal training and testing for four weeks. Each training session involved an initial examination followed by thirty minutes of board training. The time to perform each task was measured with accuracy measurements for the appropriate tasks. Statistical analysis was done with one-way analysis of variance, with significance set at p {\textless} 0.05. RESULTS: Forty-seven medical students, twenty-nine attending physicians, and fifty-eight orthopaedic surgery residents participated in the study. Stratification among medical students, junior residents, and senior residents and/or attending physicians was found in all tasks. The twenty-five medical students who were retained for longitudinal training improved significantly above junior resident level in four of the six tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The FORS is an effective simulator of basic motor skills that translates across a wide variety of operations and has the potential to advance junior-level participants to senior resident skill level. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The FORS simulator may serve as a valuable tool for resident education.},

abstract = {There is a growing consensus that 3D printing technologies will be one of the next major technological revolutions. While a lot of work has already been carried out as to what these technologies will bring in terms of product and process innovation, little has been done on their impact on business models and business model innovation. Yet, history has shown that technological revolution without adequate business model evolution is a pitfall for many businesses. In the case of 3D printing, the matter is further complicated by the fact that adoption of these technologies has occurred in four successive phases (rapid prototyping, rapid tooling, digital manufacturing, home fabrication) that correspond to a different level of involvement of 3D printing in the production process. This article investigates the effect of each phase on the key business model components. While the impact of rapid prototyping and rapid tooling is found to be limited in extent, direct manufacturing and, even more so, home fabrication have the potential to be highly disruptive. While much more value can be created, capturing value can become extremely challenging. Hence, finding a suitable business model is critical. To this respect, this article shows that 3D printing technologies have the potential to change the way business model innovation is carried out, by enabling adaptive business models and by bringing the 'rapid prototyping' paradigm to business model innovation itself.},

abstract = {Circular Economy (CE) is a growing topic, especially in the European Union, that promotes the responsible and cyclical use of resources possibly contributing to sustainable development. CE is an umbrella concept incorporating different meanings. Despite the unclear concept, CE is turned into defined action plans supported by specific indicators. To understand what indicators used in CE measure specifically, we propose a classification framework to categorise indicators according to reasoning on what (CE strategies) and how (measurement scope). Despite different types, CE strategies can be grouped according to their attempt to preserve functions, products, components, materials, or embodied energy; additionally, indicators can measure the linear economy as a reference scenario. The measurement scope shows how indicators account for technological cycles with or without a Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) approach; or their effects on environmental, social, or economic dimensions. To illustrate the classification framework, we selected quantitative micro scale indicators from literature and macro scale indicators from the European Union ‘CE monitoring framework'. The framework illustration shows that most of the indicators focus on the preservation of materials, with strategies such as recycling. However, micro scale indicators can also focus on other CE strategies considering LCT approach, while the European indicators mostly account for materials often without taking LCT into account. Furthermore, none of the available indicators can assess the preservation of functions instead of products, with strategies such as sharing platforms, schemes for product redundancy, or multifunctionality. Finally, the framework illustration suggests that a set of indicators should be used to assess CE instead of a single indicator.},

abstract = {During the past decades increase in the worldwide population resulted in raised consumption of plastic products (e.g., household appliances, packaging, construction, medicine, electronics, and automotive and aerospace components.), which has lead to adverse environmental impact and resource depletion. One of the solutions to address this problem is recycling of plastic products. Plastic recycling is the output of intermediate stages of collection, sorting by type, and processing of polymers. Plastic recycling reduces the quantity of residues in landfills and those indiscriminately discarded in the environment. Thus recycling lead to reducing the chance of diseases spread due to contamination of water, air and soil. In this article, plastic recycling as the state of art review has been projected with prospect to minimize the environmental pollution. Three different case studies of plastic recycling by reinforcement of banana fiber (BF) in polymer matrix have been presented for field engineers. The thermoplastics (like: ABS, PA6, HDPE and LDPE) have been selected (based upon their field applications) and extruded by twin screw extrusion (TSE) in filament form (Diameter: 1.75 mm) for 3D printing applications. Further studies have been conducted, to check effects of process parameters on the mechanical, thermal and morphological properties of extruded plastics reinforced with BF.},

abstract = {This paper presents a case study of a transdisciplinary research based on an ex-post assessment of the environmental and socio-behavioral contexts of solid waste management in Lebanese peri-urban communities. Lessons learned are compiled into the Transdisciplinary Interventions for Environmental Sustainability conceptual framework. The approach starts with building a team of researchers and non-academic partners, continues with co-creating solution-oriented knowledge, and ends by integrating and applying the produced knowledge. The co-created knowledge includes the environmental and socio-behavioral ex-post assessment's results. The former reveals low air pollution levels, evidence of waste-related water contamination, and higher self-reported frequencies of ill-health symptoms and diseases closer to the landfill. The latter indicates that the community's perception about waste production differs from the real accounting of generated waste. Nine lessons are identified: (1) inherent common interest between the researchers and the community, (2) flexible interdisciplinary research team, (3) representative citizen committee, (4) contextually-informed outreach coordinator, (5) iterative research process accounting for the shifting socio-political context, (6) common expectations of the research process, (7) boundary objects leading to spin-off activities in the same setting, (8) effective communication strategy, and (9) ex-post assessment of subsequent societal and scientific impacts. The non-phased framework links all nine pointers in a logical order to ease scalability. The study answers a global need for a unified, clear, broadly adopted framework for transdisciplinarity and a deeper understanding of factors ensuring full-circle knowledge co-creation in waste-related contexts in the global South. The study offers managerial and research implications and suggests avenues for further research.},

To quantify and evaluate the ecological civilization development, this study has introduced the ecological civilization index of China (ECI), using different standardization methods (extreme standardization, single-benchmark progressive standardization, and double benchmark progressive standardization), to evaluate ecological civilization development on city-level (337 cities) of China. The issues of China's ecological civilization construction were analyzed. The evaluation results suggest that in the double benchmark progressive method, every evaluation score has its practical meaning and is therefore suitable for policy making. This study obtained an average ECI score of 61.16, for 337 cities. This is China's overall ECI score, which is classified as C-grade. Only 4.75{\%} of cities' green environment (GE) score obtained A-grade, while 53.41{\%} of cities' GE scored below the passing level, suggesting that the quality of the ecology and environment is neglected in the development of China eco-civilization.

India also has the world's highest number of young people in the 10–24 years age group. The study applied the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) model to predict school students' recycling intentions in Delhi, the capital of India and one of the highest producers of municipal solid wastes in the country. Data were collected from a school in New Delhi and the sample size consisted of 272 students from 9th and 10th grades. The TPB model explained 56{\%} of the variance in the students' intentions to recycling. The predictor ‘subjective norm' appeared to have the strongest impact on the students' recycling intentions, followed by ‘attitude' and ‘perceived behavioural control'. It indicated that social factors are driving the Indian youth's recycling intentions. It is important that the policymakers promote recycling as a social trend in India and provide adequate facilities to the public so that they can participate in recycling activities without facing difficulties. Schools also have a role in increasing students' awareness of recycling and motivating them to participate in household waste management practices.},

We introduce the nine papers included in this special issue and highlight the rich variety of their contribution with reference to our organising framework. Diagnosing from a strategic perspective, we position SM strategy in and for innovation as an overlapping interaction between dynamic capabilities (sensing, seizing, reconfiguration) and the level of stakeholder engagement (macro, meso, micro). We explain how each interaction holds distinctive synergy in an open and collaborative innovation process. This organising framework shows how the malleable nature of SM creates opportunities for firms to engage widely distributed knowledge sources, enhance innovation capabilities and empower internal human resources towards an open and collaborative culture. Yet, we warn that all is not as rosy as it seems and a purposeful and coherent strategy that delivers distinctive ‘co-ownership' experiences is quintessential ingredient to realise profits from SM use in innovation.},

abstract = {The goal of the research was the determination of the properties and printability of polymeric materials made from the recycled polymers, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). From the primary (virgin) polymers and secondary (recycled) polymers that were obtained from the separately collected fractions of waste packaging, compression moulded plates were produced. The tensile properties of 1. mm and 2. mm thin plates were correlated with some structural characteristics: melting point, melting enthalpy and crystallinity degree. It was determined that the recycling process changes the melting behaviour, lowers the crystallinity and to some extent influences the tensile properties of plates. LDPE and HDPE compression moulded plates were printed with the UV inks on the large format digital UV inkjet printer Oc?? Arizona. To investigate the printability of plates made from the recycled materials some of their surface properties were determined. Higher optical density, area of ink coverage and dot gain of the printed HDPE plates compared to the LDPE plates are the consequence of higher roughness, higher surface energy with prevailing part of the polar component. By adding 4{\%} of coloured master batch to the recycled polymer at moulding, the uniformity of colour is improved leading to the higher print quality. The results have shown that the digital UV inkjet printing technique could be applied for printing recycled polyethylene plastic materials, used for disposable low cost packaging products. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is acknowledged for its potential to support sustainable design. In this paper, we explore whether the opportunities that additive manufacturing offers for sustainable design are also useful when designing for a circular economy, and to what extent additive manufacturing can support design for a circular economy. We performed a literature review on the sustainability aspects of additive manufacturing and held a series of interviews with designers about their 3D printed design projects to obtain in-depth information. The interviews were analysed using annotated portfolios, a novel analysis method created specifically for this research. This resulted in a visual representation of the outcomes. We found that additive manufacturing supports circular design strategies by creating opportunities to extend a product's lifespan, for instance by enabling repair or upgrades, even if these products were not originally designed for ease of repair or upgrading. However, the use of monolithic structurally complex parts that support design for recyclability may hinder high value product recovery, like repair. Besides this, the current offer of 3D printable materials should be extended with materials developed for durable use, as well as high-value reuse. Concluding, when accounting for these drawbacks, additive manufacturing is able to support multiple product life cycles and can provide valuable contributions to a circular economy.},

abstract = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most widely used additive manufacturing processes for fabricating prototypes and functional parts in common engineering plastics. The process is based on the extrusion of heated feedstock plastic filaments through a nozzle tip to deposit layers onto a platform to build parts layer by layer directly from a digital model of the part. The simplicity, reliability, and affordability of the FDM process have made the additive manufacturing technology widely recognized and adopted by industry, academia, and consumers. The FDM process has also been widely used by research and development sectors to improve the process, develop new materials, and apply the FDM systems in a wide range of engineering applications. This chapter describes an overview of the basic process, materials, and capabilities of the Stratasys FDM technology, and also presents a comprehensive review of research and development work undertaken using the FDM process since its inception over the past two decades. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {DDD Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate how physical spaces intersect with innovation and innovativeness, and what the most relevant attributes of physical space are for innovation. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reflects the changing nature of innovation, from technological advancements to services and meaning changes, and argues that the development of innovative spaces similarly embodies a diverse set of values such as collaboration, openness, and sustainability. Using a literature review, interviews, and benchmarking data, the paper examines the relationship between physical environment and innovation. Findings – The findings from both the literature review and the interviews underline innovation as a communicative and human-centred process. As a result five attributes of innovative space are presented: collaboration enabling, modifiability, smartness, attractiveness, and value reflecting. Originality/value – The results provide perspectives to the challenge of how to support innovation creation by developing physical spaces. The paper adds to the conceptual development of innovative space and outlines physical space as an innovative service.},

abstract = {The establishment of recycling systems aiming at high-quality recyclates from post-consumer plastic waste are essential to avoid the waste of resources. One main impediment for introducing recyclates into the market is their unwanted odor. For this reason, this study aimed at determining if the collection strategy affects the odor profile of post-consumer LDPE bags. Furthermore, the effect of hot water washing, inspired by the conventional mechanical recycling procedure, on the odor of post-consumer LDPE bags was screened. More than 60 odorants were detected in LDPE bags collected in a separate plastic fraction as well as in LDPE bags from the non-separated collection by means of gas chromatography-olfactometry, and 37 of them were unequivocally identified using two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry. The sensory results revealed that the type of collection affects the overall odor intensity, the hedonic tone of the odor and the odor profile. Namely, cheesy and fecal smelling odorants were predominant in the waste that had not been separated at source, whereas odorants with earthy and moldy smells showed mostly higher intensity ratings in the waste separated at source. Short chain carboxylic acids, likely originating from microbial spoilage of organic waste, were found with higher dilution factors in the mixed fraction, and could, accordingly, contribute to the observed differences. Additionally, we could show that the hot washing procedure, applied to the LDPE sample from the separate collection system, significantly reduced the overall odor intensity from 8 to 6.3 (0–10 scale). However, the washed waste still showed high smell intensity ratings.},

Thixotropic inks were formulated by dispersing nanoclay, carbon black, and polymer in an organic solvent, and then 3D multifunctional sensors were prepared by direct ink writing (DIW). Sequential removal of solvent and nanoclay yielded a porous polymer/carbon black structure, which maintained excellent elasticity and compression cyclability. The presence of carbon black in the foams led to good electrical conductivity and stable piezoresistive sensing signals at a strain of up to 80{\%}, including the ability to distinguish human motions. Complementary to a decrease in resistance upon compression, the foam can be used as a gas sensor device, as exposure to volatile organic compounds causes the polymer to swell and an increase in resistance.

Spatial interventions refer to the strategic scope of actions that can be undertaken when and while using innovation spaces. We approach the topic of spatial interventions from different perspectives and shed light on crucial aspects of how innovation spaces can be used as a ‘silent coach.' This approach takes into consid- eration the conceptual interplay of the strategic discourse, theoretical accounts of coaching practice and the process of using innovation spaces. We further introduce a framework for spatial interventions that helps to structure and analyze the use of space during a workshop. Finally, based on findings from a case study that was conducted in the newly created innovation space of a large company, we apply and expand this theoretical framework. The approaches and findings of this chapter support both strategists and practitioners and contribute to a deeper understanding of how to make use of space as a strategic tool.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the challenges of the industry increasingly demand the manufacture of complex shapes with great design flexibility without waste by 3D printing. Additive manufacturing, unlike traditional manufacturing techniques such as casting and machining, enables designers to rapid prototype while lowering operating costs and material waste during this process. In this way, understanding the current state of the literature related to additive manufacturing processes and the mechanical properties of 3D printed materials is of high importance to determine a research horizon in developing future works of this topic. In this paper, a bibliometric analysis, also named Scientometric science, was implemented. The tendencies and transcendental topics were determined using the Bibliometrix package for R and VOSviewer. Data were exported directly from the Scopus database with a search equation. The results showed that, of the 1271 documents analyzed, 2015 is a year where the research began its developing stage, with a growth rate of 20.8{\%}. The USA resulted to be a leading country in publications followed by China and the UK. Likewise, it is observed that the author with the highest number of publications and h-index is C.B. Williams, followed by A.A. Zadpoor and J. Muller. Besides, the evolution in time of the keywords most used by researchers, and trends and research gaps in the study of additive manufacturing with the mechanical properties of the 3D printing materials are presented.},

abstract = {We witness a persistent tension between established ways of knowledge production through disciplines, and the urgent need to widen and change, both the production of knowledge and its organization, not least, in order to be able to understand and address the future and its challenges. Witnessing a growing call for inter- and transdisciplinarity (ITD), we set our goal to learn more about scholars who engage in this kind of research by asking these questions: What characterizes inter- and transdisciplinary researchers (ITDRs)? To what extent do these characteristics help ITDRs deal with the challenges of an academic career path? We address both questions by comparing the findings from the relevant literature and semi-structured interviews with ITDRs at different stages in their careers. Our results bring the ITDR personality a step further in taking a form. ITDR personalities can be characterized by a particular mix of motivations, attitudes, skills, and behaviors. However, the academic environment and its career paths do not seem prepared and adapted for such ITDR personalities. Furthermore and in contrast to the literature, the T-shaped training (first, disciplinary depth and then, ITDR) is considered one possible career path, with the other one being a specialization in facilitating knowledge integration and in developing theories, methods, and tools for ITD. Our analysis concludes by exploring the future of ITD if formal training and learning would be available and if the contextual conditions would be more conducive to undertaking this type of research.},

As such, disciplinary incentives encourage design, analysis, and reporting decisions that elicit positive results and ignore negative results. Prior reports demonstrate how these incentives inflate the rate of false effects in published science. When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive-getting it right-competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive-getting it published.

abstract = {Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has become a popular research topic among scholars as evidence suggests it has significantly contributed to achieve more environmentally conscious and socially responsible supply chains. Operational excellence (OE), on the other hand, can be achieved by incorporating SSCM practices within existing supply chain operations. However, due to human expertise, involvement and commitment towards excelling at sustainable and operational performance, the effective deployment of SSCM practices now depends on various human-based behavioral factors (BFs). Human behavior is dynamic in nature and hence has an effect on the implementation of SSCM practices. Nevertheless, research on BFs in view of SSCM practices is limited. To fill this knowledge gap, this study examines the nature of BFs for SSCM practices towards OE in supply chains, particularly within the context of the footwear industry of Bangladesh. In the first phase, the BFs were identified and determined through a literature review and empirical investigation. In the second phase, the Hesitant Fuzzy DEMATEL method was used to establish the cause-effect relationships among the factors. The influence of group validation by experts and a literature survey, along with managerial implications, was discussed and explained in the third phase of the study. The results suggest that the factor, ‘organization culture' is the most influencing behavioral factor, followed by ‘commitment from higher authority'. Both theoretical and practical contributions of the study are drawn from its findings, helping footwear industry managers to more effectively adopt SSCM practices in the supply chain operations of their organizations to achieve OE.},

To collect the data for the study, a self-administered questionnaire was run with 312 consumers from India. The data were analyzed for assessment of the measurement and structural models via structural equation modeling. The findings indicate that environmental consciousness and recycling intentions significantly moderate the impact of perceived consumer effectiveness (PCE)and willingness to be environmentally friendly (WEF)on GPB. The study offers managerial insights for green marketers to operate in fast growing emerging markets.

Unlike the ro-botics-based food manufacturing technologies designed to automate manual processes for mass production, 3D food printing integrates 3DP and digital gastronomy technique to customize food products. This introduces artistic capabilities into domestic cooking and extends customization capabilities to the industrial culinary sector. Its ap-plication in domestic cooking or catering services can not only provide an engineering solution for customized food design and personalized nutrition control, but also has the potential to reconfigure customized food supply chains. In this paper, the selected prototypes are reviewed based on fabrication platforms and printing materials. A de-tailed discussion on specific 3DP technologies and the associated dispensing/printing process for 3D customized food fabrication with single and multi-material applications is reported. Lastly, impacts of food printing on custo-mized food fabrication, personalized nutrition, food supply chain, and food processing technologies are discussed.},

abstract = {Circular business models aim to preserve the value of material resources in society by slowing and closing resource flows. Various models have been identified, including the Extending Product Value business model, which plays a role in extending product lifetimes by reversing product obsolescence. However, the characteristics of these business models and their associated environmental consequences have remained largely unexplored in research. This paper aims to address this gap by analysing three types of Extending Product Value business models and reflecting on their resource efficiency contributions. A framework, developed from an analysis of 56 firms, is used to facilitate this reflection. The framework considers the level of interaction between the product and firm and introduces three Extending Product Value business model archetypes: Facilitators, Redistributors, and Doers. The analysis suggests that different environmental impacts are relevant for each type of firm, and the higher the firm-product interaction, the greater the resource efficiency potential of the business model. The paper also suggests characteristics that should be considered if such business models are to contribute to a more resource-efficient circular economy. The findings are relevant for a variety of actors interested in the circular economy, including researchers assessing the resource efficiency of business models, firms interested in developing new resource-efficient business models or increasing the resource efficiency of existing ones, and policymakers promoting the adoption of circular business models.},

Using a configurational approach (involving complementarity and equifinality), we propose that firms use different OI configurations, by combining three openness practices (high number of alliances, partner diversity, and external R{\&}D) and four complementary organizational assets (human capital, alliance coordination capabilities, inter-organizational learning capabilities, and patenting orientation), and that such configurations affect OI performance. We conducted a survey study on the Spanish biotech industry. A sample of 75 companies was analyzed using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results revealed seven high-performing configurations and six low-performing configurations. Configurations combining one or more OI practices and complementary organizational assets achieved a high OI performance, while open configurations lacking the necessary organizational assets were not successful. Closed configurations also performed poorly. The theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present novel modifications to a RepRap design that increase RepRap capabilities well beyond just fused filament fabrication. Open-source RepRap 3-D printers have made distributed manufacturing and prototyping an affordable reality. Design/methodology/approach - The design is a significantly modified derivative of the Rostock delta-style RepRap 3-D printer. Modifications were made that permit easy and rapid repurposing of the platform for milling, paste extrusion and several other applications. All of the designs are open-source and freely available. Findings - In addition to producing fused filament parts, the platform successfully produced milled printed circuit boards, milled plastic objects, objects made with paste extrudates, such as silicone, food stuffs and ceramics, pen plotted works and cut vinyl products. The multi-purpose tool saved 90-97 per cent of the capital costs of functionally equivalent dedicated tools. Research limitations/implications - While the platform was used primarily for production of hobby and consumer goods, research implications are significant, as the tool is so versatile and the fact that the designs are open-source and eminently available for modification for more purpose-specific applications. Practical implications - The platform vastly broadens capabilities of a RepRap machine at an extraordinarily low price, expanding the potential for distributed manufacturing and prototyping of items that heretofore required large financial investments. Originality/value - The unique combination of relatively simple modifications to an existing platform has produced a machine having capabilities far exceeding that of any single commercial product. The platform provides users the ability to work with a wide variety of materials and fabrication methods at a price of less than {\$}1,000, provided users are willing to build the machine themselves.},

This article raises attention to the central role of trust in such reflexive arrangements. Although the relevance of trust in learning is often acknowledged, there is not yet a clear understanding of how trust influences learning processes. Many different roles are attributed to trust, leading to conceptual confusion. This article develops a heuristic framework for studying the relationship between trust and reflexive learning, which is regarded as a continuous process of reaction, interaction and anticipation. The framework also proposes an analytical distinction between (inter-) personal, (inter-) organizational and system dimensions of trust in reflexive arrangements, which enables analysis of trust and learning interactions.},

However, the material undergoes physical and chemical changes due to repeated heating cycles in the SLS equipment. This causes variations in powder characteristics and performance in the SLS process. With the increased utilization of SLS for direct manufacturing it is necessary to develop a characterization and testing system that can determine powder fitness to ensure process stability and part quality. Current powder recycling methodologies use an average virgin-to-used powder mixture. In a new approach, a testing mechanism to deliver a numerical, measurable material characterization will be discussed. Experimental results of repeated reuse of material and its resulting physical effects on mechanical properties, shrinkage, and chemical tests will be presented. A definitive testing and measurement process control will be shown to improve process stability and thus part quality and consistency. Introduction},

Waste composite materials are complex as many different polymer types exist which can be filled with various types of fillers. The process of mechanical recycling is to collect, sort, size reduce, separate and densify these wastes, economically and effectively. Identification and labelling of these materials aids consumer input to the recycling process. Flotation or hydro-cyclone separation uses densities as a means to separate, issues surrounding the effectiveness of such systems are discussed. Near infrared and electrostatic sorting are effective techniques as individual composites can be identified and segregated. Densification can occur by simple pelletisation or by sophisticated extrusion processing. The techniques are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The cleaning efficiency of a PET recycling process is typically investigated by artificial contamination of post-consumer PET flakes within a so-called challenge test. Challenging of pilot plants or industrial scale lines is done be introducing a certain amount of contaminated flakes while running the process with non-contaminated flakes of different colour. After decontamination the contaminated flakes are separated from the non-contaminated flakes and only the contaminated flakes were analysed due to their residual contamination level. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), however, raised the question about cross-contamination, which might reduce the overall cleaning efficiency of the recycling process. Cross-contamination is defined as the transfer of surrogate contaminants from the initially contaminated to the initially not contaminated material during a challenge test. Data for the phenomenon of cross-contamination are not available in the scientific literature. Aim of the study was to close this gap by providing experimental data for cross-contamination by use of several challenge tests. As a result cross-contamination was found only at ratios of 1:1 between contaminated and non-contaminated PET flakes. At higher ratios which were typically applied in challenge tests on pilot plant or industrial scale line cross-contamination do not play a significant role. In addition, the results show that cross-contamination is negligible for volatile compounds.},

This paper provides further evidence for these critics. The aim of this paper is to create transparency regarding the current understandings of the circular economy concept. For this purpose, we have gathered 114 circular economy definitions which were coded on 17 dimensions. Our findings indicate that the circular economy is most frequently depicted as a combination of reduce, reuse and recycle activities, whereas it is oftentimes not highlighted that CE necessitates a systemic shift. We further find that the definitions show few explicit linkages of the circular economy concept to sustainable development. The main aim of the circular economy is considered to be economic prosperity, followed by environmental quality; its impact on social equity and future generations is barely mentioned. Furthermore, neither business models nor consumers are frequently outlined as enablers of the circular economy. We critically discuss the various circular economy conceptualizations throughout this paper. Overall, we hope to contribute via this study towards the coherence of the circular economy concept; we presume that significantly varying circular economy definitions may eventually result in the collapse of the concept.},

abstract = {Osteoporosis leads to bone fragility and represents a major health problem in our aging societies. Bone is a quasi-brittle hierarchical composite that exhibits damage with distinct crack morphologies in compression and tension when overloaded. A recent study reported the complex damage response of bovine compact bone under four different cyclic overloading experiments combining compression and tension. The aim of the present work is to propose a mechanistic model by which cracking bone accumulates residual strain and reduces elastic modulus in distinct compressive and tensile overloading modes. A simple rheological unit of bone with two types of cracks is formulated in the framework of continuum damage mechanics. A statistics of these rheological units is then assembled in parallel to compute the response of a macroscopic bone sample in which compressive and tensile cracks are opened, closed or propagated towards failure. The resulting constitutive model reproduces the key macroscopic features of bone tissue damage and delivers an excellent agreement with the four cyclic overloading experiments. The remarkable predictions of the model support the presence of (1) friction between the crack surfaces producing hystereses, (2) an incomplete closure of cracks leading to residual strains, (3) a bridging mechanism of collagen fibrils which failure reduces elastic modulus, and (4) two distinct classes of cracks where compressive cracks have a strong influence on tensile damage and tensile cracks have a limited impact on compressive damage. This work is expected to help improve our understanding of the bone damage mechanisms contributing to skeletal fragility and to foster a proper generalization of this damage behavior in 3D for computational analysis of bone and bone-implant systems.},

abstract = {Sustainable Development is recognized as one of the biggest societal challenges of the twenty-first century. Higher Education Institutions have the vision, the knowledge and the power to lead this transition, and to induce the changes towards this new paradigm. As a result, sustainability values need to be incorporated in Higher Education Institutions' mission and practice. Although some successful case studies have been reported, there is a lack of consolidated methodologies to support an integrated and holistic implementation of sustainability, as well as to identify the opportunities associated with this process. The present research contributes to this literature by presenting the implementation of the sustainability vision of University of Minho (between 2009 and 2017), in a holistic and inclusive perspective, demonstrating the engagement and alignment of the Academic Community and the Rectorate. Based on the findings it is possible to derive some important lessons for the implementation of Sustainability Strategies in Higher Education Institutions. A mixed Bottom-up and Top-Down approach is seen as a key element for the successful change of the organizational culture. The implementation of sustainability policies that address all mission areas and the continuous monitoring and communication is crucial to demonstrate the commitment to all stakeholders. In addition, the integration of collaborative networks and the institutionalization of sustainable policies contribute to consolidate and strengthen the commitment with sustainability. The considered methodology and findings can significantly contribute to enrich the existent literature on reporting HEI sustainability practices, and to promote Sustainability Strategies in Higher Education Institutions, and other organizations, provided that their intrinsic nature is accounted for.},

Change Laboratory{\textregistered} represents an example of the social process of innovation during which new ideas are developed and put into action within an organization. We suggest that successful social processes of innovation can be promoted through expansive learning in Change Laboratories. Change Laboratory is based on cultural-historical activity theory and provides a set of instruments for innovating through expansive learning. In this article, we illustrate a process of learning on a case example from Finnish health care. The case shows how Change Laboratory was applied to develop a surgical unit of a university hospital in Northern Finland. The social process of innovation involved the development of a new organizational and leadership model. In conclusion, we suggest that organizations can improve their capacity to innovate through expansive learning in Change Laboratory interventions. In order to understand the process of innovation the contradictions and their transformations need to be understood in the scrutinized activity.},

In comparison with fusion-based high-temperature additive manufacturing processes, cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) has been shown to retain the original properties of the feedstock, to produce oxide-free deposits, and to not adversely influence underlying substrate materials during manufacture. Therefore, CSAM is attracting considerable attention from both scientific and industrial communities. Although CSAM is an emerging additive manufacturing technology, a body of work has been carried out by various research groups and the technology has been applied across a range of manufacturing areas.

abstract = {Plastic is a versatile material that has contributed to numerous product innovations and convenience in everyday life. However, plastic production is growing at an alarming rate, and so has the generation of plastic waste. Unsound waste management results in plastic leakage to the environment with multiple adverse effects to ecosystems. Incineration of plastic waste produces excessive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while plastic as a material is consumed and cannot be used again as a resource within a circular economy framework. For this reason, the European Union (EU) takes measures to increase plastic recycling, introducing higher targets for recycling in its revised waste legislation. Sweden follows suit, prioritising actions for improving the management of plastic waste. In this contribution, three scenarios of future plastic waste management are analysed for their sustainability impacts by 2030. The analysis is enabled by a plastic waste management flow model that calculates environmental, economic, and social impacts. The indicators used in the model to describe the impacts in each axis of sustainability are (1) GHG emissions, (2) monetary costs and benefits, and (3) number of jobs created. The results indicate several trade-offs between the different scenarios and between the different sustainability aspects of future plastic waste management, with their strengths and weaknesses duly discussed. Concluding, the most promising and sustainable future scenario for plastic waste management in Sweden includes high targets for recycling—in line with EU targets—and a gradual phase-out of plastic incineration as a waste management option.},

abstract = {This review synthesizes diverse approaches that researchers have brought to bear on the challenge of sustainable development. We construct an integrated framework highlighting the union set of elements and relationships that those approaches have shown to be useful in explaining nature–society interactions in multiple contexts. Compelling evidence has accumulated that those interactions should be viewed as a globally interconnected, complex adaptive system in which heterogeneity, nonlinearity, and innovation play formative roles. The long-term evolution of that system cannot be predicted but can be understood and partially guided through dynamic interventions. Research has identified six capacities necessary to support such interventions in guiding development pathways toward sustainability. These are capacities to ( a) measure sustainable development, ( b) promote equity, ( c) adapt to shocks and surprises, ( d) transform the system into more sustainable development pathways, ( e) link knowledge with action, and ( f) devise governance arrangements that allow people to work together in exercising the other capacities.},

abstract = {The availability of digital technologies such as 3D printing can allow members of the public rather than only producers, to innovate. Makerspaces, where communities of individuals share access to such technologies may therefore support the democratisation of innovation. Yet little is known about how and why makerspace members use 3D printing to realise their creative and commercial ambitions. Through an ethnographic study, we identify a bricolage approach whereby makerspace members combine 3D printing with whatever resources are at hand in a makerspace, to generate innovations that otherwise may not be realised. In this context, we find bricolage entails synergy - combining resources in creative ways - and openness - a willingness to gather and share resources. We confirm that bricolage restricts commercial growth such that a need for more structured processes and perhaps a move away from makerspaces eventually becomes necessary. We contribute to theory by presenting makerspaces as a route to innovation in resource constrained contexts, or those in which neither a problem nor solution are clearly defined. This contrasts with crowdsourcing where problems but not solutions are defined, and R{\&}D where both problem and expected solution are defined.},

Although advanced supply chain optimization models are available, the literature shows that value creation in closed loop supply chains is limited by too many constraints. Strategic success factors may relax these constraints. This study investigates business practices in the closed loop supply chain of four brand owners in capital goods. We find that strategic success factors may relax constraints but they themselves are also constrained, as multiple stakeholders are involved, each having different interests. In all four cases studies, the interaction between success factors and constraints leads to vicious cycles. Breaking these cycles proves to be difficult and requires integral thinking particularly among internal stakeholders of the brand-owners. Further research is needed to differentiate between different types of cycles, e.g. in a taxonomy, and different stakeholder viewpoints, both quantitative and qualitative.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing technologies, such as selective laser melting of polymers enable manufacturing of complex parts without tools and forms. Due to high temperature during processing, a degradation of the used plastic powder occurs. The unmolded material in the building chamber, the so-called partcake, can be removed from the finished component after building and reused for another process. To realize reproducible part properties refreshing of partcake powder is necessary. This paper presents results on the investigations of degradation behavior of polyamide 12 powder during selective laser melting process. The influence of different ambient conditions, e.g. ambient air, nitrogen and vacuum, is investigated in a model experiment. Oven aged polymer powders were analyzed with regard to their process relevant material properties. Considered material properties are phase transition temperatures, melting viscosity or molecular weight. The results of the investigations show, that the influence of high process temperatures on used material can be reduced using other ambient conditions. Process relevant material properties are minor affected by storage under vacuum. In addition to that the influence of different ambient conditions as well as a material pretreatment on the degradation behavior of sls materials, e.g. exclusion of intermolecular located oxygen, is analyzed. To correlate these results of the model experiment with real manufacturing process laser sintering experiments are done. PA12 powder is used for several building processes with refreshing. Produced specimens and resulting partcake powder are analyzed and correlated to the results of model experiment. Correlating effects, regarding process relevant material properties as well as aging influenced mechanical properties of specimens can be detected.},

abstract = {The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was used to guide an analysis of intentions to recycle household waste in a geographical area (Glasgow, Scotland) with relatively poor recycling facilities. A sample of 252 members of the public completed a questionnaire (response rate of 66{\%}). In addition to TPB variables, the contributions of past recycling behaviour, perceived habit of recycling, and perceived lack of recycling facilities were considered. The TPB components contributed 29{\%} to the variance of intentions to recycle; attitudes and perceived behavioural control (PBC) (but not the subjective norm) were significant on entry. Past recycling and perceived habit made significant independent contributions. Contrary to expectations, there was some evidence to suggest that (a) the past behaviour-intention relationship was stronger for those with no perceived habit of recycling, and (b) the attitude-intention relationship was stronger for those who had recycled more in the past. There was also evidence to suggest that the PBC-intention relationship was weaker when facilities were perceived to be lacking. The findings highlighted methodological, theoretical, and social issues, and it was concluded that full account should be taken of the social context in such research. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We approach these adoption challenges as a problem of gaining support for organizational innovation. Through a mixed-method research design consisting of qualitative interviews and a survey of employees of a large telecommunications firm, we find that the organizational innovation to commercially engage in OSS has different impacts on technical and administrative dimensions of different job roles. Accordingly, individuals enacting different job roles are - on average - more or less well aligned with the OSS practice and OSS processes per se. We find that individual-level attributes can counterbalance the job role changes that weaken support for adopting OSS, while perceived organizational commitment has no effect. Suggestions for PCSS firms are presented and implications for innovation literature are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a revival in growth scepticism, yet degrowth in relation to the macroeconomic level has received almost exclusive attention. This resulted in a lack of literature on how post-growth and specifically degrowth visions of economy could be implemented, including from the perspective of firms and other organisations. This paper focuses on degrowth literature and fields of knowledge which share a similar or sympathetic perspective regarding the undesirability of economic growth and desirability of living within planetary boundaries while pursuing wellbeing. It then applies degrowth vision to firms and identifies potential elements of a business for a degrowth economy, here referred to as a degrowth business. These elements comprise a degrowth business framework. The framework is centred around the following groups: (1) environment, (2) people and non-humans, and (3) deviation from profit maximisation imperative. It aims to contribute to an emerging discussion on what firms should be like for a degrowth economy and society to be possible.},

abstract = {Despite offering robust mechanical properties, polymer networks suffer from a lack of recyclability, reshaping, and healability. Designing stiff and remendable polymer networks that can repair under mild conditions remains a challenge to extend their field of applications. Herein, we describe a simple approach to design a nonisocyanate-based polyurethane network featuring multiresponsiveness (to humidity and temperature) and outstanding healing properties, as obtained by combining iminoboronate and boroxine chemistry. In spite of the presence of abundant dynamic bonds, the network has a high stiffness (Young's modulus of 551 MPa) and tensile strength (11 MPa). C═N iminoboronate and B–O boroxine exchange reactions at high temperature enable efficient network recycling over multiple cycles without compromising its properties. Owing to these features, 3D objects could be designed and printed. The present approach provides excellent sustainable and high-performance substitution to conventional polyurethane networks requiring the use of toxic isocyanates.},

@article{Tang2016,
abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) also known as 3D printing technology has drawn increasing attention from the industrial world. It provides the capability of freeform fabrication to achieve high complexity as well as significant reduction of a supply chain which further enhances the profit margin for manufacturers. However, while claiming on the advantage on the environmental aspect, there is very limited research on the environmental impact of AM technologies. Most of existing environmental assessment models for AM processes are developed based on a general Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework. Due to the limited scope and boundary of these models, design results are usually taken as the input. These existing models may work well for traditional manufacturing processes. However, when it comes to AM process, these methods are no longer valid, since the design freedoms which may have a great impact on sustainability are always neglected. To deal with this issue, a general framework which can integrate a design stage in LCA for minimizing the product environmental impact of AM process in particular for binder-jetting process is proposed. The detailed description of each major stage of the proposed framework is presented. This framework has been applied to evaluate the environmental impact of fabricating an engine bracket by binder-jetting process. In this case study, a comparison of environmental impact between CNC and binder-jetting fabrication process is made. The result shows that binder-jetting consumes significantly less energy and produce less CO2 to produce a topologically optimized part than CNC milling for the same product. This case study demonstrates a key role of design optimization in the proposed framework. This proposed framework can be further modified for other typical AM process in the future.},

Also, they are easy to formulate into different devices for carrying a variety of drug classes such as vaccines, peptides, proteins, and micromolecules. Also, they have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for drug delivery. This review discusses the various traditional and novel techniques (such as in situ microencapsulation) of preparing various drug loaded PLGA devices, with emphasis on preparing microparticles.

abstract = {In plastics industry it is a common practice to mechanically recycle waste material arising from production. However, while plastics are mechanically recycled, their mechanical properties change. These changes may affect material processing conditions and quality of the end products; therefore they need to be quantified. In this study, mechanical recycling of high density polyethylene (HDPE) was simulated by one-hundred (100) consecutive extrusions cycles. During extrusion, processability of virgin HDPE and its recyclates was studied by recording the processing conditions, i.e. melt pressure and extrusion torque, while after preparation of the recyclates, melt flow index measurements (MFI), small amplitude oscillatory shear tests (rheological properties), and differential scanning calorimetry measurements (DSC) of thermal properties were performed. Also, mechanical properties in solid state were characterized in terms of hardness and modulus measured by nanoindentation, and finally, shear creep compliance was measured to characterize the materials' time-dependent mechanical properties and its durability in solid state. In addition, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and solubility tests were implemented to study changes in the material structure. The results on rheological and MFI measurements indicate significant structural changes in the material that occurred during the first 30 extrusion cycles. Those changes affect material processability which is as well supported by the recorded processing pressure and torque. On the other hand, processing did not significantly affect material thermal properties. Results on hardness and modulus show deterioration of the material mechanical properties after 10th reprocessing cycle. Similarly, shear creep compliance measurements showed an unfavourable effect of mechanical recycling on the time-dependent mechanical properties, particularly after the 30th extrusion cycle. In addition, results suggested chain branching as a dominating mechanism through first 30 extrusion cycles, domination of chain scission afterwards and also presence of cross-linking after 60th extrusion cycle.},

abstract = {In this paper, we are going to present the Living Lab concept. Through the last few years, many researchers have been arguing about this controversial term. Thus, there is a plethora of definitions been given to them and many case studies have been conducted, so as to conclude to a generally accepted explanation of this marketing phenomenon. The Living Lab (LL) theory is based on an Open Innovation ground and it co-exists with other marketing and production strategies such as Mass Customization, Open Source, Open Evaluation, Lean Production and so on, aiming to cover customers desires as much as possible. More and more organizations are confronted with highly dynamic external ecosystems. This notion is not an optional activity, but it stems from the fact that consumers seem to be more sophisticated and demanding about what fits their needs better. Colossal companies apply or even, are willing to adapt, these new ways of thinking. Moreover, European countries have already detected the emerging needs leading to the establishment the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL). In periods of economic recession, innovation prevails and companies need to change their minds and be more “open” and conciliatory. The purpose of this shift is to utilize the majority of information deriving from all kinds of users. Till now, Marketing departments emphasize in approaching only the lead-users. Due to the fact that neither personalization nor customization was discerned, a vast amount of customers were unsatisfied. To conclude, users should have a dual action: they should be both innovators and developers. This will assist products and services to become more adaptive in real markets.},

abstract = {In an important contribution in Ecological Economics, van de Bergh (2010) correctly concludes that sustainability does not imply zero externalities. However, he continues with the Delphic statement "(Delphic statements were uttered by the renowned oracle of ancient Greece at Delphi. They were phrased in such a way as to be self-fulfilling because alternative interpretations covered every possibility.)" "Without externalities the problem of sustainability vanishes". If this statement refers to an impossible economic process that produces no externalities then he is right. However, it might be interpreted as stating that whenever environmental policy internalizes environmental externalities then sustainability will be ensured. In this note, I assert that in the real world where externalities prevail, their internalization or neutralization in the traditional way cannot lead to sustainability. Only if internalization takes a very specific form that results in the inviolable preservation of environmental rights of future generations in pure biological terms can sustainability be ensured. After revised the original commentary I resubmit it. The issues raised by the editor have been carefully considered. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This overview highlights some of the key aspects regarding materials qualification needs across the additive manufacturing (AM) spectrum. AM technology has experienced considerable publicity and growth in the past few years with many successful insertions for non-mission-critical applications. However, to meet the full potential that AM has to offer, especially for flight-critical components (e.g., rotating parts, fracture-critical parts, etc.), qualification and certification efforts are necessary. While development of qualification standards will address some of these needs, this overview outlines some of the other key areas that will need to be considered in the qualification path, including various process-, microstructure-, and fracture-modeling activities in addition to integrating these with lifing activities targeting specific components. Ongoing work in the Advanced Manufacturing and Mechanical Reliability Center at Case Western Reserve University is focusing on fracture and fatigue testing to rapidly assess critical mechanical properties of some titanium alloys before and after post-processing, in addition to conducting nondestructive testing/evaluation using micro-computerized tomography at General Electric. Process mapping studies are being conducted at Carnegie Mellon University while large area microstructure characterization and informatics (EBSD and BSE) analyses are being conducted at Materials Resources LLC to enable future integration of these efforts via an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering approach to AM. Possible future pathways for materials qualification are provided.},

abstract = {The circular economy (CE) is a new model for the production and consumption of goods, which has attracted wide political attention as a strategy toward sustainability. However, the theoretical foundation of CE remains poorly structured and insufficiently explored. Recent studies have shown that the CE model draws on different schools of thought and that its origins are mainly rooted in fields such as industrial ecology (IE) and ecological economics (EE). In this article, we investigate the links between CE, IE, and EE and provide an overview of the similarities and differences between these fields. At the same time, we analyze to what extent the linkages between IE and EE can create a coherent body of knowledge for CE, and be used to identify further research opportunities. This paper shows that, until now, research on CE seems to be mainly rooted in the field of IE and based on concepts and tools that already exist in other fields, rather than inventing new ones. The reconciliation of IE and EE could provide a mechanism to extend beyond such a narrow focus, and increase knowledge of the theoretical and practical framework of CE to benefit sustainability.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a dental implant surgery simulator that allows learners to experience the drilling forces necessary to perform an osteotomy in the posterior mandibular bone. The simulator contains a force-sensing device that receives input and counteracts this force, which is felt as resistance by the user. The device consists of an actuator, a load cell, and a control unit. A mandibular bone model was fabricated in which the predicted forces necessary to drill the cortical and trabecular bone were determined via micro CT image-based 3D finite element analysis. The simulator was evaluated by five dentists from the Department of Implantology at Tokyo Dental College. The ability of the evaluators to distinguish the drilling resistance through different regions of the mandibular bone was investigated. Of the five dentists, four sensed the change in resistance when the drill perforated the upper cortical bone. All five dentists were able to detect when the drill made contact with lingual cortical bone and when the lingual bone was perforated. This project successfully developed a dental implant surgery simulator that allows users to experience the forces necessary to drill through types of bone encountered during osteotomy. Furthermore, the researchers were able to build a device by which excessive drilling simulates a situation in which the lingual cortical bone is perforated--a situation that could lead to negative repercussions in a clinical setting. The simulator was found to be useful to train users to recognize the differences in resistance when drilling through the mandibular bone.},

Materials requirements for AM include the ability to produce the feedstock in a form amenable to the specific AM process, suitable processing of the material by AM, capability to be acceptably post-processed to enhance geometry and properties, and manifestation of necessary performance characteristics in service. As AM has matured, specific classes of material have become associated with specific AM processes and applications. This paper gathers this information for each of the seven categories of ISO/ASTM AM categories. Polymers, metals, ceramics and composites are considered. Microstructural features affecting AM part properties are listed. Service properties of AM parts are described, including physical, mechanical, optical and electrical properties. An additive manufacturability index is proposed.},

abstract = {3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer design using patient-specific anatomical data. Since its initial use as pre-surgical visualization models and tooling molds, 3D Printing has slowly evolved to create one-of-a-kind devices, implants, scaffolds for tissue engineering, diagnostic platforms, and drug delivery systems. Fueled by the recent explosion in public interest and access to affordable printers, there is renewed interest to combine stem cells with custom 3D scaffolds for personalized regenerative medicine. Before 3D Printing can be used routinely for the regeneration of complex tissues (e.g. bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, nerves in the craniomaxillofacial complex), and complex organs with intricate 3D microarchitecture (e.g. liver, lymphoid organs), several technological limitations must be addressed. In this review, the major materials and technology advances within the last five years for each of the common 3D Printing technologies (Three Dimensional Printing, Fused Deposition Modeling, Selective Laser Sintering, Stereolithography, and 3D Plotting/Direct-Write/Bioprinting) are described. Examples are highlighted to illustrate progress of each technology in tissue engineering, and key limitations are identified to motivate future research and advance this fascinating field of advanced manufacturing.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional printing (3DP) or additive manufacturing is regarded as an environmentally friendly and sustainable form of manufacturing, which allows circular manufacturing as the 3D printed waste and products can be recycled for further 3DP operations. Due to the fact that the reclaimed material is commonly perceived to have poorer quality than the virgin material, the pricing of materials and printed products are crucial for consumers to decide their printing and material selection decisions. We consider a closed-loop competitive circular supply chain comprising (1) a 3DP platform that provides 3DP services to print products from virgin and recycled materials, (2) material suppliers that provide virgin and recycled materials (filaments) for the platform, and (3) end users who use the platform to print their products. We derive the prices, demands, and profits of the 3DP platform and material suppliers in Stackelberg equilibrium. We also conduct numerical studies using real-life data to generate practical insights from the analytical findings. Most interestingly, we find that while the platform prefers, both types of suppliers avoid, printing high-quality products from recycled material. We derive management insights and policy implications from the analytical and numerical findings for the closed-loop competitive circular supply chain.},

abstract = {Packaging waste production, especially single-use containers, is exerting detrimental effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, including human health. To internalise the externalities associated with single-use containers, different instruments, including a deposit refund scheme (DRS), have been operationalised in many countries. Therefore, DRS is introduced in Scotland to reduce plastic litters by increasing recycling rates and incentivising pro-environmental behavioural change. This study addresses the complexity of single-use plastic containers by analysing consumers' perceptions regarding the introduction of DRS in Scotland. Using 940 comments from the BBC “Have Your Say” messageboard, this study adopts sentiment analysis to understand consumers' opinions about the introduction and implementation of DRS in Scotland. Findings suggest that a UK-wide scheme that is similar in terms of operations and structure is required for DRS to be successful. While consumers' knowledge and opinions about DRS are mixed, the efficacy of DRS including its relevance is questioned and raises doubts about its contribution to sustainability. The findings imply the need for UK countries to negotiate and collaborate on appropriate and attractive interventions in addressing post-consumer single-use plastic containers. The implications of the findings for policy and practice, especially in improving the operations of DRS are further discussed.},

In order for RepRap printed parts to be useful for engineering applications the mechanical properties of printed parts must be known. This study quantifies the basic tensile strength and elastic modulus of printed components using realistic environmental conditions for standard users of a selection of open-source 3-D printers. The results find average tensile strengths of 28.5 MPa for ABS and 56.6 MPa for PLA with average elastic moduli of 1807 MPa for ABS and 3368 MPa for PLA. It is clear from these results that parts printed from tuned, low-cost, open-source RepRap 3-D printers can be considered as mechanically functional in tensile applications as those from commercial vendors.},

This study quantifies the basic tensile strength and elaxstic modulus of printed components using realistic environmental conditions for standards users of a selection of open source 3D printers


Conclusion:

The results show that the average tensile strength of RepRap printed parts is 28.5 MPa for ABS and 56.6 MPa for PLA with an average elastic modulus of 1807 MPa and  3368 MPa for PLA.

These results indicate that the 3D printed components from RepRaps are comparable in tensile strength and elastic modulus to the parts printed on commercial 3D printing systems.

abstract = {Plastic lumber manufactured using post consumer waste plastic has been proposed as an acceptable material for use in the construction of docks, piers and bulkheads and is touted to outlast conventional wood products due to its strength, durability and resistance to rot. This study examines the long-term engineering properties of plastic lumber manufactured using post consumer waste plastic (TRIMAX, Ronkonkoma, NY). Plastic lumber profiles were used in the decking of a pier built in West Meadow Creek, Old Field, NY during December 1995. Samples of plastic lumber were removed from the deck of the pier periodically over a two-year period and returned to the laboratory for testing. Results of engineering tests showed the in-plane compression modulus (260??30 MPa), dimensional stability and the Shore D surface hardness (60??2) of plastic lumber removed from the pier remained similar to or greater than their pre-placement values. In contrast, significant changes in the modulus of elasticity of plastic lumber were measured with prolonged weathering. The modulus of elasticity of plastic lumber initially decreased from 1370 Pa to 750 Pa following 12 months weathering, a decrease equal to 45{\%} of its pre-placement value and then increased during the second year to close to its initial value. The high variability in the modulus of elasticity should restrict the use of plastic lumber profiles to non-load bearing structural applications. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Its proponents aim to contribute to sustainable development by closing materials cycles and realising a fundamental paradigm shift in the thinking concerning industry–ecology relations. Dominant research lines in industrial ecology focus on industrial metabolism and life cycle tools. The underlying assumption is that the flow and transformation of materials can be managed through the correcting of market and regulatory failures which are causes of environmental degradation. This literature review suggests, on the one hand, that the manageability of the flow of materials is currently limited by market and regulatory failures which inhibit the implementation of the principles of industrial ecology and, on the other hand, that the flow and transformation of materials are only partly affected by prices, information and laws.},

Based on earlier literature, this study investigates commonalities and differences in the prototyping behavior of engineers and designers. For this study, semi-structured interviews and workshops with different experiments were conducted. Using low-fidelity prototypes, our results indicated that there are differences in the early phase of prototyping. Engineers focused on the features and functions of a prototype and needed to meet specific goals in order to push the process forward. Designers, on the other hand, used prototypes to investigate the design space for new possibilities, and were more open to a variety of prototyping materials and tools, especially for low-fidelity prototypes. In the later prototyping phases, the prototyping behaviors of engineers and designers became similar. Our study contributes to the understanding of prototyping purposes, activities, and processes across disciplines, and supports the management of prototyping in new product development processes.},

abstract = {This paper presents an explorative study dedicated to the evaluation of immersive environments engaging different stakeholders that have to collaborate within an innovation process in the area of smart cities supported by a dedicated Fab Living Lab platform. A previous study has unveiled the great potential of close-to-real-life immersion perceived by users/citizens in realistic environments that not only fulfill the “realism” principle of a Living Lab but also greatly contribute to both phenomena of technology acceptance and adoption of the proposed solution. Scholars have previously identified three main factors characterizing an immersive environment: the perceived degree of immersiveness, presence and engagement of users. However, creating close to real-life simulated city environments that provide an appropriate immersiveness, presence and engagement remains a challenge. Furthermore, the traditional working habits of smart cities stakeholders, such as: territorial engineers, town-planners and policy makers, are not prepared for behaving properly in immersive environments. Several experiments were carried out during different events that provided both quantitative and qualitative data through the use of surveys, interviews and observations. For each experiment, several immersive equipment were used. The findings highlight the complementarity between physical and digital technologies supporting co-creation for smart city projects, and the advantage of enabling experts in a field to discover new technologies. Finally, this study provides valuable elements on how to better support close to real-life simulated city environments while providing a higher level of stakeholders' engagement during the ideation of the co-creation stage of the innovation process supported by a Fab Living Lab towards the realization of smart cities.},

abstract = {This paper consists in a review of environmental issues of additive manufacturing technologies, mainly in those related to fused deposition modelling. The versatility, reduction of equipment costs due to patents expiring and the great flexibility offered by 3D printers have driven the amazing increase of these technologies in the last years. On the other hand, the democratization of additive manufacturing also poses some issues regarding environment; it is important to also have into account the potential effects of these technologies in the environment, coming from energy consumption, materials, and wastes produced. A review of different research works dealing with environmental impact of additive manufacturing, such as products' life cycle assessment, energy and materials consumption, and particles and gases releases (mainly due to health issues), has been performed. The assessment performed has helped highlighting the importance of environmental issues in additive manufacturing, according to the number of published papers. The main findings are the importance of establishing a method for applying eco-design principles taking into account the specific features of additive manufacturing.},

abstract = {In this forum paper we discuss how soil scientists can help to reach the recently adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the most effective manner. Soil science, as a land-related discipline, has important links to several of the SDGs, which are demonstrated through the functions of soils and the ecosystem services that are linked to those functions (see graphical abstract in the Supplement).We explore and discuss how soil scientists can rise to the challenge both internally, in terms of our procedures and practices, and externally, in terms of our relations with colleague scientists in other disciplines, diverse groups of stakeholders and the policy arena. To meet these goals we recommend the following steps to be taken by the soil science community as a whole: (i) embrace the UN SDGs, as they provide a platform that allows soil science to demonstrate its relevance for realizing a sustainable society by 2030; (ii) show the specific value of soil science: research should explicitly show how using modern soil information can improve the results of inter-and transdisciplinary studies on SDGs related to food security, water scarcity, climate change, biodiversity loss and health threats; (iii) take leadership in overarching system analysis of ecosystems, as soils and soil scientists have an integrated nature and this places soil scientists in a unique position; (iii) raise awareness of soil organic matter as a key attribute of soils to illustrate its importance for soil functions and ecosystem services; (iv) improve the transfer of knowledge through knowledge brokers with a soil background; (v) start at the basis: educational programmes are needed at all levels, starting in primary schools, and emphasizing practical, down-to-earth examples; (vi) facilitate communication with the policy arena by framing research in terms that resonate with politicians in terms of the policy cycle or by considering drivers, pressures and responses affecting impacts of land use change; and finally (vii) all this is only possible if researchers, with soil scientists in the front lines, look over the hedge towards other disciplines, to the world at large and to the policy arena, reaching over to listen first, as a basis for genuine collaboration.},

We outline a path that moves away from the existing model of scientific communication to improve the efficiency in meeting the purpose of public science-knowledge accumulation. We call for six changes: (a) full embrace of digital communication; (b) open access to all published research; (c) disentangling publication from evaluation; (d) breaking the "one article, one journal" model with a grading system for evaluation and diversified dissemination outlets; (e) publishing peer review; and (f) allowing open, continuous peer review. We address conceptual and practical barriers to change and provide examples showing how the suggested practices are being used already. The critical barriers to change are not technical or financial; they are social.

Participants were 1021 monozygotic and 722 dizygotic twin pairs and NEO Five-Factor Inventory– NEO-FFI is used to assess FFM personality traits. Results show a similar pattern of genetic and environmental contribution to the variance of all FFM dimensions, indicating that culture has no significant effect on the genetic and environmental variance of personality traits. The best fitted common factor - common AE pathway models show that FFM dimensions are accounted for by the common latent factor. Although FFM dimensions clearly share some common sources of variance, the effects of specific genetic and environmental factors are more pronounced than common ones. Different patterns of genetic and environmental correlations across three samples may reflect the way that the synergy of personality traits responds to the specificities of a particular culture, as well as possible subtle differences in item translation, testing conditions, and measurement error.},

abstract = {Educational attainment is generally a strong predictor of belief in climate change, but prior research indicates that for political conservatives a college education is not always associated with increased belief. Conservatives in several countries, especially those in populist parties, have shown skepticism toward climate-mitigation policies and in some cases toward climate science. The study contributes to theories of environmental belief by examining two mechanisms for the low effect of the college education on climate belief for conservatives: selective exposure bias (students avoid courses that challenge their beliefs) and resistance to belief change (students reject or filter information that is incompatible with their political orientation). Using a survey of college-educated adults in the U.S., the study finds strong evidence for selective exposure bias and mixed evidence for resistance to belief change. Importantly, approximately one-third of conservative students who took a college course with climate-change content shifted from initial skepticism or uncertainty to a more confident belief. Moreover, exposure to an education with a core curriculum is associated with stronger belief. The study provides support for the policy goal of a curricular requirement for climate education, which can overcome selective exposure bias and, for some students, resistance to belief change.},

abstract = {In times of climate change, biodiversity loss, or growing natural resource scarcity, the circular business model (CBM) concept is increasingly attractive, promoting the reorganization of current value creation architectures and supply chains toward a sustainable system of production and consumption. Driven by a vision of continued economic expansion and growth on a planet with finite natural resources, CBMs are endorsed by political institutions, multinational corporations, business consultancies, and academia. Some argue that CBM configurations contribute to a more holistic and radical change in the existing business logics than approaches that achieve incremental resource efficiency improvements. However, how “holistic” and “radical” are CBMs theoretically constituted in academia if we consider the deep structural and paradigmatic shifts in societies necessary to deal with the challenges associated with the Anthropocene? Prior studies do not examine the inherent normative settings and the operational change approaches beneath CBM concepts. To reconstruct the theoretical foundations of CBMs critically, the recent CBM body of academic literature is systematically reviewed according to (1) the legitimacy of CBMs (why should it be done) (2) the modes of value creation and offerings (what should be done), and (3) the core principles of CBM integration into daily business (how should it be done). From this synthesis, the predominant notion of sustainability behind the CBM concept can be revealed. This study argues contemporary scientifically constructed CBMs need to be reconsidered if they are intended to contribute to a profound economic transition toward sustainability. Hence, the paper shows how principles from more “holistic”, “radical”, and pluralistic economic approaches can widen CBMs and how future research can help to diversify the concept.},

abstract = {Mitigation of plastic waste is a serious concern for policymakers. The present waste management system in India is grossly ineffective, with a significant proportion of mismanaged plastic waste. This paper identifies the effective policy mix to mitigate the plastic waste problem in India using system dynamics modelling. It simulates four major policy interventions - charging disposal fee, provision of recycling subsidies, provision of kerbside recycling facilities and a new intervention - imposing a plastic ban - and studies their relative impacts on the accumulated plastic waste stock under different implementation scenarios and combinations. The findings suggest that while composite combinations of policies offer more effective policy mix than individual policy interventions, a suitable choice of policy mix along with its timing and extent is crucial. Phased implementation of policies has a better impact than the constant rollout of equivalent magnitude. A phased composite mix of the provision of kerbside recycling facilities with either charging disposal fee or provision of recycling subsidies is the most effective policy mix, followed by the phased mix of charging disposal fee and provision of recycling subsidy. The plastic ban has a detrimental impact in the absence of proper enforcement mechanisms and substitutes. The paper presents a reliable roadmap to policymakers for the rollout of the effective policy mix. It contributes to theory-building by providing few novel insights about different policy mix and suggests new research directions.},

abstract = {Multiple processing by means of successive injection cycles was used to simulate the thermo-mechanical degradation effects on the oligomeric distribution of PLA under mechanical recycling. Likewise, an accelerated thermal ageing over PLA glass transition was performed in order to simulate its service life. MALDI-TOF MS was used for the analysis and the sample preparation procedure was assessed by means of a statistical Design of Experiments (DoE). The quality effects in use for the analysis were signal-to-noise ratio and Resolution. Different matrixes, analyte/matrix proportions and the use of NaTFA as cationization agent were considered. A deep inspection of the statistical results provided a better understanding of the influence of the different factors, individually or in combination, to the signal. The application of DoE for the improvement of the MALDI measurement of PLA stated that the best combination of factors (levels) was the following: matrix (s-DHB), proportion analyte/matrix (1/5 V/V), and no use of cationization agent. Degradation primarily affected the initially predominant cyclic [LAC]n and linear H[LAL]nOH species, where LA stands for a PLA repeating unit. Intramolecular and intermolecular transesterifications as well as hydrolytic and homolytic reactions took place during the formation and disappearance of oligomeric species. In both degradation mechanisms induced by thermal ageing and thermo-mechanical degradation, the formation of H[LA L]nOCH3 by intermolecular transesterifications was highlighted. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The model was tested on a sample of 697 undergraduate students from four Norwegian universities who each reported their degree of participation in the local recycling schemes for paper/cardboard, glass, metal, and plastic. It was demonstrated that variance in recycling behaviour can be divided into a smaller general part that is relatively stable across waste fractions and a specific part that depends on the respective fraction. General recycling behaviour is well predicted by intentions to recycle and recycling habits, whereas perceived behavioural control is to a large extend fraction specific and influences the fraction specific recycling. Perceived behavioural control mediates the influence of the recycling scheme type, distance to recycling containers, and transport mode used to reach the recycling containers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

CE seems to be a collection of vague and separate ideas from several fields and semi-scientific concepts. The objective of this article is to contribute to the scientific research on CE. First, we will define the concept of CE from the perspective of WCED sustainable development and sustainability science. Second, we will conduct a critical analysis of the concept from the perspective of environmental sustainability. The analysis identifies six challenges, for example those of thermodynamics and system boundaries, that need to be resolved for CE to be able to contribute to global net sustainability. These six challenges also serve as research themes and objectives for scholars interested in making progress in sustainable development through the usage of circular economy. CE is important for its power to attract both the business community and policy-making community to sustainability work, but it needs scientific research to secure that the actual environmental impacts of CE work toward sustainability.},

It may sound far-fetched-but then, thirty years ago, the notion of "personal computers" in every home sounded like science fiction. According to Neil Gershenfeld, the renowned MIT scientist and inventor, the next big thing is personal fabrication the ability to design and produce your own products, in your own home, with a machine that combines consumer electronics with industrial tools. Personal fabricators (PF's) are about to revolutionize the world just as personal computers did a generation ago. Personal fabricators (PF's) are about to revolutionize the world just as personal computers did a generation ago. PF's will bring the programmability of the digital world to the rest of the world, by being able to make almost anything-including new personal fabricators. In FAB, Gershenfeld describes how personal fabrication is possible today, and how it is meeting local needs with locally developed solutions. He and his colleagues have created "fab labs" around the world, which, in his words, can be interpreted to mean "a lab for fabrication, or simply a fabulous laboratory." Using the machines in one of these labs, children in inner-city Boston have made saleable jewelry from scrap material. Villagers in India used their lab to develop devices for monitoring food safety and agricultural engine efficiency. Herders in the Lyngen Alps of northern Norway are developing wireless networks and animal tags so that their data can be as nomadic as their animals.

abstract = {This paper conducts an embedded case study to verify a conceptual framework by which biopharma research in Do-It-Yourself (DIY) laboratories can be integrated into Research and Development (R{\&}D) networks of the pharmaceutical industry. As an early attempt to extend the perspective of business innovation ecosystem into the research on DIY laboratories, this study reveals three major findings. First, DIY laboratories, contract research organizations (CROs) and pharmaceutical firms interdependently position and link with each other in an innovation ecosystem for new drug development. Second, through properly managing the issues of resource utilization and innovation appropriability, CROs play important hub and knowledge broker roles in coordinating and aligning different priorities and expectations of the key players in this innovation ecosystem. Third, this study maps and verifies two knowledge transfer models through which novel research findings in DIY laboratories can be converted into real commercial returns.},

While research has uncovered many macro-level attributes of such partnerships, the micro-level, including the human side, of these inter-organizational relationships is only partly understood. We especially lack an understanding of how individual, manager-level characteristics facilitate company collaboration with partners such as universities. Applying a micro-founda-tional lens and building on 10 qualitative case studies, we identify how companies' human capital helps overcome barriers and enhance the drivers of university-industry collaboration. We propose a two-dimensional framework consisting of companies' human capital components and their managerial roles for university partnerships -attitudinal, relational, and cognitive-to guide future research on human capital in the context of university-industry strategic partnerships. The framework will also assist managers and recruiters in better understanding the role of human capital in their collaborations with universities.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of Triple Helix systems as an analytical construct that synthesizes the key features of university-industry-government (Triple Helix) interactions into an 'innovation system' format, defined according to systems theory as a set of components, relationships and functions. Among the components of Triple Helix systems, a distinction is made between (a) R{\&}D and non-R{\&}D innovators; (b) 'single-sphere' and 'multi-sphere' (hybrid) institutions; and (c) individual and institutional innovators. The relationships between components are synthesized into five main types: technology transfer; collaboration and conflict moderation; collaborative leadership; substitution; and networking. The overall function of Triple Helix systems - knowledge and innovation generation, diffusion and use - is realized through a set of activities in the knowledge, innovation and consensus spaces. This perspective provides an explicit framework for the systemic interaction between Triple Helix actors that was previously lacking, and a more fine-grained view of the circulation of knowledge flows and resources within and among the spaces, helping to identify existing blockages or gaps. From a Triple Helix systems perspective, the articulation and the non-linear interactions between the spaces can generate new combinations of knowledge and resources that can advance innovation theory and practice, especially at the regional level.

abstract = {Human capital development, attractions of sustainable living standards and renewed concerns for the planet have redirected city planners to a new frontier: the creation of sustainable cities. This is evident in some initiatives taken to create cities with low to zero carbon emissions, build sustainable structures and create higher institutions of learning where sustainability practices are entrenched in their curricula. Examples of the forerunners of sustainable cities are abound; from the Middle East (Education City in Qatar and Masdar City in Abu Dhabi) to Far East (Dongtan Institute in China and New Songdo City in South Korea), new cities imbued with sustainability practices are springing forth. There are 400 big cities and 23 mega cities presently occupying the world urban spaces, with estimates of about one and 10 million inhabitants, respectively. Ironically cities occupy about 2{\%} of the earth surface, they however consume 60–80{\%} of global energy. The global urban population rose from 220 million to about 2.8 billion in the 20th century, and it is projected that by 2050, this will increase to 6.9 billion, which is about 70{\%} of the world population. Therefore, sustainability campaigns, when directed at cities, would have intended impacts due to a number of factors associated with cities: large population, hub of intellectual and social integration, high consumption, etc. In creating modern sustainable cities however, the attention of cities' planners and policymakers alike should be on those goals that come under the banner of sustainability, especially when designing new or retrofitting existing human settlements (the cities); such as human capital development, energy conservation and energy efficiency, water security, efficient use of earth-abundant resources, transportation, building standards, social and economic equity, and food wastes management. Although there are few review articles in the literature that separately deal with individual sustainability fundamentals, there is a dearth of publication consolidating key sustainability principles required for modern cities. This paper reviewed each element needed to make a functional sustainable city. We adopted a simple approach; we explained each sustainability principle, highlighted its core values and gave reasons why it is an important candidate to be considered in making a working city. We critiqued the current sustainable cities by stating reasons for their strengths and explanations for their deficiencies. We engaged the future sustainable cities' planners to learn from the failures of some of the earlier hurriedly executed sustainable cities in order to have the most important elements of sustainability present in their future project execution.},

abstract = {The last four decades produced exponential development in the polymer processing. Radiation processing - initiated also about 40 years ago - yielded a similar pathway of development in the beginning, mostly in the radiation crosslinking of polymers and in the radiation sterilization of polymer products. There are some unexpected results in the developments of the radiation chemistry of polymers utilized well in the polymer processing today. The most dynamical developments of the microelectronics in our days are based on the efficient utilization of radiation-crosslinkable negative photoresist polymers and the radiation degradable positive photoresist polymers. Rapid prototyping and rapid tooling are indispensable methods in the continuously renewing manufacturing technologies of metal and plastic parts for almost all the industrial branches. Polymer composite manufacturing is also profited in many ways from the experiences of radiation technology. Compatibilization through radiation-reactive monomers and oligomers is attacking two great fields of the future polymer processing. Recycling of commingled polymer wastes, and manufacturing new type of alloys of different synthetic as well as natural polymers are requiring well-engineered interface, which can be achieved by radiation processing in a technically feasible and economically viable way. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The market for homemade and handcrafted items has expanded significantly in recent years. Related activities range from community-supported agricultural activities, tinkering at home, renovating our houses, design elements, and defining space in the world of gastronomy and fashion as well, and it extends to cover many other activities, where the "producers" also double up as the consumers. The number of scientific analyses in Hungarian language dealing with this subject is very low and no deep empirical results (interviews, questionnaires, ethnographic analyses, etc.) to support our scientific experience exist yet. The purpose of this study is first to review the terminology issued and difficulties that are related to this phenomenon, and, based on the results of a questionnaire survey, and secondly to explore the motivations of DIYers and the attitudes behind their actions. In our study, we mean on Do-It-Yourself (DIY)-in line with the vast majority of literature-all activities, services, and products, which is implemented by own hands not under industrial circumstences. The target group of the online questionnaire survey was the people that are involved in DIY. The questionnaire was shared by a decorator and her DIY Facebook page ("Juditu") on 3 October 2017. The size of the relevant sample was 270. The research questionnaire was built up from a demographic part, a part that is related to general DIY activity, and a part that sought to find the motivation of DIY members. The practice of DIY activities might be linked more to the personality and creativity; so, the group can be more homogeneously described along the common personality traits than by demographic variables. Among the motivations of DIYers the economic one (saving money) is not the most dominant. Analyses by interpretative index categories confirmed the hypothesis that it is difficult to separate one motivational force from the other; in many cases, one catalysing force generates the other, thus a complex multifactorial motivational set dominates the study target group. From the three groups, which were identified by analysing the motivations, in two groups those individuals are dominant, which use DIY activities to express their own inner world, and for whom spending time creatively, making something alone and for themselves, and creating something useful and valuable, is very important. These results were novel and, naturally, they can be perfect starting points of further studies because of the intactness of the research topic.},

abstract = {With changing consumption patterns, growing populations and increased urbanisation, developing countries face significant challenges with regards to waste management. Waste plastic is a particularly problematic one, with single-use plastic leaking into the environment, including the marine environment, at an unprecedented rate. Around the world, countries are taking action to minimise these impacts, including banning single-use plastics; changing petroleum-based plastics to alternative bio-benign products such as paper, glass or biodegradable plastics; and improving waste collection systems to ensure that all waste is appropriately collected and reprocessed or safely disposed. However, these “solutions” are often met with resistance, from business, government or civil society, due to the intended and unintended consequences, leaving many questioning the most appropriate solution to reducing the leakage. This paper argues that there is no one single solution to addressing the leakage of plastic into the environment, but that the solution is likely to be a combination of the three approaches, based on local considerations.},

abstract = {Growth rates were determined for copepodites of the genera: Acartia, Centropages, Corycaeus, Oithona, Paracalanus, Parvocalanus and Temora in nearshore waters of Jamaica from in situ microcosm incubations. At these high local temperatures (similar to 28 degrees C), total copepodite development time was as short as 4 to 5 d. Mean instantaneous growth rates (g) ranged from as high as 1.2 d(-1) to as low as 0.1 d(-1). In general, cyclopoid copepods appeared to grow more slowly than calanoids of the same size. Enhancement of resources by nutrient addition caused a 32{\%} increase in growth rates in experiments from a mesotrophic site, but only a 17{\%} increase at a more eutrophic site. Additionally, copepodites at both sites showed faster development and generally larger size at stage in response to nutrient addition. Growth rates were positively related to chlorophyll concentration in the {\textgreater}2 mu m size-fraction. A significant relationship of growth rate to body size (r(2) = 0.45) emerged across a wide range of trophic status, but it was confounded with resource availability. It appears that growth in tropical copepod copepodites may be frequently limited by resources in a size-dependent manner.},

abstract = {In many countries, the contribution of unorganized or micro-retailers to the overall economy and sustainability is a topic of increasing importance. Although these retailers are commonly dependent on the intermediaries for trading, there is scarce literature addressing the influence of intermediaries in green supply chain practice. This study explores the repercussions of a dominant intermediary in a three-echelon green supply chain under price and greening level sensitive demand in both single and two-period setting. The results demonstrates that the manufacturer is able to sell maximum amount of products and the retailer receives higher profits if an intermediary dominates the market. A dominant intermediary can urge the manufacturer to promote products with a lower greening level. In such scenario, the unit R{\&}D investment in producing green products is less, but each participant may receive higher profits. A sequential profit-sharing mechanism is proposed from the perspective of the manufacturer that can be employed under leadership of the wholesaler. Under this mechanism, the retailer can maintain strategic inventory, each member can receive higher profits, and most importantly, the manufacturer can promote products at highest greening level to achieve sustainability goals. If consumer takes into account the GL-price ratio, then two-period procurement planning always outperforms single period optimal decision under manufacturer-Stackelberg game. The insights can assist manufacturers to create a foundation for sustainable business practices.},

Three key quality properties were defined and analysed; these were the degree of mixing (composition), the degree of degradation, and the presence of low molecular weight compounds. Polymeric contaminations of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) were detected in some samples using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Vibrational spectroscopy showed the presence of oxidised parts of the polymeric chain and gave also an assessment of the microstructure of the polybutadiene phase in HIPS. The presence of low molecular weight compounds in the HIPS samples was demonstrated using microwave-assisted extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Several volatile organic compounds (VOCs), residues from the polymerisation, additives, and contaminations were detected in the polymeric materials. Styrene was identified already in virgin HIPS; in addition, benzaldehyde, $\alpha$-methylbenzenaldehyde, and acetophenone were detected in recycled HIPS. The presence of oxygenated derivates of styrene may be attributed to the oxidation of polystyrene (PS). Several styrene dimers were found in virgin and recycled HIPS; these are produced during polymerisation of styrene and retained in the polymeric matrix as polymerisation residues. The amount of these dimers was highest in virgin HIPS, which indicated that emission of these compounds may have occurred during the first life-time of the products. This paper demonstrates that a combination of different analytical strategies is necessary to obtain a detailed understanding of the quality of recycled HIPS. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Technology and innovation policy has been the core of economic development since the 1950s. Moreover, the increasing rate of technological developments allowed policy and strategy makers to think about technology emergence for proactive planning. In this sense, technological emergence became popular with different applications and foresight studies. However, even though it is a popular concept in the literature, an accepted formal definition is lacking. In this study, we propose a definition based on review as; “Technological emergence is a cyclic process in highly creative scientific networks that demonstrates qualitative novelty, qualitative synergy, trend irregularity, high functionality, and continuity aspects in a specified time frame”. We discuss and explain the definition by demonstrating it in a multi-dimensional model to make it understandable and applicable for future studies. Finally, we discuss it with existing literature and propose future implications.},

abstract = {Historically, universities and institutions of higher learning have gone through three academic revolutions, namely, teaching, research, and innovation. Universities and Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in the last two decades have come to occupy an important part in the national innovation systems (NIS), which is a complex of ‘all important economic, social, political, organizational, institutional and other factors that influence the development, diffusion and use of innovations'. From a broader perspective, universities, together with public Research and Development (R{\&}D) labs and science agencies, public policies (on industry, research, innovation and higher education, etc.) and business enterprises are now considered as important actors in the NIS of Asia-Pacific economies. The rise of Asia in the global knowledge-based economy from mid-1990s is closely associated with the rise of knowledge institutions of higher learning and scientific research output. Every Asia-Pacific country embraced and introduced policies relating to innovation in varying forms. Consultancy and collaborative links with industry being traditional forms of engagement, new policy and institutional measures in technology transfer and innovation to engage with society and business enterprises are gaining prominence. Policies for incubation, start-ups, and spin-offs, technology transfer offices (TTOs), and science and technology parks have gained tremendous prominence in leading Asia-Pacific universities. Different national innovation systems in the Asia-Pacific region have given rise to varying roles of universities. Whilst universities in Southeast Asian countries and India continue to play a traditional role of teaching and generating human capital, there are countries such as Singapore, China, Taiwan, and Japan, wherein universities are being transformed as entrepreneurial universities. Science and innovation policies in these countries have orchestrated the goal direction of universities as frontiers of innovation. Universities in Australia and New Zealand have so far been quite successful in marketing higher education to neighboring Asian countries. They have in recent years begun to embark on innovation and commercialization of research. The paper focuses on South East Asia and draws some comparison with more dynamic university ecosystems in East Asia. In doing so, the paper brings into focus the emerging innovation landscapes across the region.},

abstract = {PLA is an organic polymer that lends itself to multiple applications. It is commonly used in fused deposition modeling technology (FDM), which operates by depositing successive layers of material. The material extrusion, in the form of a wire, follows an imposed pattern, which influences the static and dynamic behavior of the final component. In the literature there are many works concerning the mechanical characterization of the PLA but, due to the natural orthotropy of the FDM process and, above all, to the ascertained influence of the particular technical system with which the operations are performed, it is necessary to characterize the extruded material through different metrological techniques. In order to allow the use of this technology for structural elements production, in the present work, quasi-static tests have been carried out to characterize the material and the process considering the three spatial growth directions (x, y and z). In particular, uniaxial tensile tests were performed for the determination of mechanical strength, modulus of elasticity and percentage elongation.},

abstract = {The Circular Economy (CE) is currently a popular notion within the policy and business advocacy groups. Despite being visionary and provocative in its message, the research on the CE concept is emerging. The two intertwined objectives of the paper are; first to identify, discuss and develop the various definitions provided by the emerging literature. Secondly, to suggest an initial research approach with which research on CE can be conducted. Our analysis shows that the existing CE work is mainly done on the practical and technical levels of the actual physical flows of materials and energy in production-consumption systems. The focus of the extant literature is on concrete metrics, tools, instruments and computations. Therefore, the basic assumptions concerning the values, societal structures, cultures, underlying world-views and the paradigmatic potential of CE remain largely unexplored. We argue that CE has already become what Gallie (1955) more than six decades ago termed as an “essentially contested concept” (ECC). The paper further suggests a model for CE research that helps in the categorization, classification and organization of research and investigation on CE. The model can help in limiting the observed unbalance and enhance the contribution of the CE approach to a more sustainable global society.},

abstract = {Efforts to promote open-science practices are, to a large extent, driven by a need to reduce questionable research practices (QRPs). There is ample evidence that QRPs are corrosive because they make research opaque and therefore challenge the credibility, trustworthiness, and usefulness of the scientific knowledge that is produced. A literature based on false-positive results that will not replicate is not only scientifically misleading but also worthless for anyone who wants to put knowledge to use. So, a question then arises: Why are these QRPs still so pervasive and why do gatekeepers of scientific knowledge such as journal editors, reviewers, funding-agency panel members, and board members of professional organizations in charge of journal policies not seem to be taking decisive actions about QRPs? We address these questions by using a science-practice analogy to identify the existence of a science-practice gap in open science. Specifically, although there is abundant research on how to reduce QRPs, many gatekeepers are not adopting this knowledge in their practices. Drawing upon the literatures on the more general science-practice gap and QRPs, we offer 10 actionable recommendations for narrowing the specific science-practice gap in open science. Our recommendations require little effort, time, and financial resources. Importantly, they are explicit about the resulting benefits for the various research-production stakeholders (i.e., authors and gatekeepers). By translating findings on open-science research into actionable recommendations for “practitioners of research”, we hope to encourage more transparent, credible, and reproducible research that can be trusted and used by consumers of that research.},

abstract = {Individual waste sorting is necessary for effective, efficient waste management. Despite active government interventions, waste sorting has achieved limited success in China. Previous research provides contradictory theories and mixed evidence of the relationship between perceived environmental governance and individual waste sorting behavior. Some researchers argue that perceived environmental governance enhances individual engagement by offering a supportive atmosphere, whereas the crowding out thesis suggests that it undermines intrinsic motivation and suppresses participation. This study suggests that the controversy is partially attributed to people's varying expectations for central and local governments. Multivariate analyses of nationally representative data in China show that a positive evaluation of local government motivates individuals' sorting behavior, whereas the perceived effective environmental governance of the central government decreases individual engagement, net of demographic and socioeconomic factors. Additionally, people in danwei and affordable housing communities who perceive the central government's environmental governance to be effective are more likely to sort waste. Institutional trust and the involvement of local actors may lead to differential outcomes. These findings suggest that waste sorting results from systematic evaluations of both individual preferences and institutional settings, and effective environmental governance requires more nuanced measures to evoke intrinsic motivation, preferably at the community level.},

abstract = {Research shows urban sustainability experiments are critical for sustainability transition in cities and beyond, especially when they are multiplied in other contexts and upscaled. Even with a growing body of literature on sustainability experiments, little is known on how these experiments travel to and are contextualized in other contexts. Here we attempt to fill this gap, taking the adoption and proliferation of Energy Performance Contracting (EPC)in Shanghai as a case study. First, based on the system innovation literature, we identify the critical components that characterize the innovative practices. We then examine the contextualization process of EPC in Shanghai using this characterization. Finally, we identify and compare some innovative elements that emerged during the contextualization with those in the original contexts from which Shanghai learned. We argue that post experiment adoption and contextualization requires mobilization and realignments of actors, resources, and institutional arrangements within the process of learning, which involves much more than simple duplication and often with distinctive outcomes, thus in many ways is an innovation in itself. Innovation in post experiment contextualization is supported by various “horizontal linkages” with the original experiment, which include information/knowledge transfer and learning via actor interactions across experiments, but the focus of learning shifts from external (i.e. from the original context)to internal (i.e. within the new context)during the contextualization process. These findings contribute to an in-depth understanding of how innovation can transfer across cases, which is a significant gap in current system innovation literature, and may inform practice in terms of how to facilitate the scaling of experiments to achieve sustainability transitions.},

abstract = {This paper describes the fatigue behaviour of newly developed all-polypropylene (all-PP) tapes and composites, with reference to the composite processing conditions, testing temperature and making a comparison with commercial alternatives. All-PP tapes are highly oriented and their failure behaviour follows that of other highly oriented polymers. All-PP woven composites fail ultimately due to PP tape failure. However, this failure mode is accompanied by delamination of fabrics in the woven structure. Consolidation pressure plays a decisive role in controlling the interlaminar properties and hence the delamination resistance and furthermore the fatigue limit of the composite. Comparison of all-PP woven composites with commercial alternatives based on glass and natural fibres reveals the excellent relative performance of all-PP composites under fatigue loads. Fatigue properties of all-PP composites are however sensitive to the testing temperature, and elevated temperatures can lead to a rapid reduction of the fatigue resistance of these all-polymer systems.},

abstract = {Creative achievement of teams is increasingly recognized as an organization's most valuable production. With dramatically advancing technology producing an almost unlimited amount of available information, the crucial challenge to many corpo- rate and government organizations is how to use that informa- tion most creatively. While little expense is spared on identifying and training teams to enhance their potential for creative achievement, little is known about how, or if, the physical designed environment of these organizations supports creative achievement of teams. This review of literature across the dis- ciplines of creativity, organizational behavior, and environment and behavior studies advocates a position for the physical environment in the context of creativity. Creative team charac- teristics and social influences are linked to properties and attributes of the physical office environment.},

abstract = {Stimulated by new ecology-driven European and national regulations, new routes of recycling waste appear on the market. Since food packages represent a large percentage of the plastics consumption and since they have a short lifetime, an important approach consists in making new packages from post-consumer used packages. On the other hand, food-packaging regulations in Europe require that packaging materials must be safe. Therefore, potential mass transfer (migration) of harmful recycling-related substances to the food must be excluded and test methods to ensure the safety-in-use of recycled materials for food packaging are needed. As a consequence of this situation, a European research project FAIR-CT98-4318, with the acronym 'Recyclability', was initiated. The project consists of three sections each focusing on a different class of recycled materials : polyethylene terephthalate (PET), paper and board, and plastics covered by functional barriers. The project consortium consists of 28 project members from 11 EU countries. In addition, the project is during its lifetime in discussion with the US Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) to consider also US FDA regulatory viewpoints and to aim, as a consequence, to harmonizable conclusions and recommendations. The paper introduces the project and presents an overview of the project work progress. {\textcopyright} 2002 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The present study examined the conditions under which highlighting past pro-environmental behaviour produces a “license” to engage in less pro-environmental behaviour: a phenomenon known as moral licensing. It also examined whether highlighting a lack of past pro-environmental action would lead to moral cleansing, where people engage in moral behaviour to maintain a positive moral self-image. It extends the existing literature on moral licensing and moral cleansing by exploring environmental attitudes as a moderator of the effect of people's past pro-environmental behaviour on their subsequent actions. Participants (N = 213) completed the Environmental Attitude Scale and were then exposed to either a stronger green credentials manipulation, or a weaker green credentials manipulation, or they took part in a control group. As a key dependent variable, they were then provided with an opportunity to find out about their personal carbon footprint, with their responses being interpreted as possible evidence of moral licensing/cleansing. There was evidence that participants with more pro-environmental attitudes who were reminded of frequent previous pro-environmental behaviour were less likely to seek information about their carbon footprint (consistent with a moral licensing effect) and that participants with less positive environmental attitudes who were reminded of infrequent previous pro-environmental behaviour were more likely to seek such information (consistent with to moral cleansing). The findings are discussed in relation to spillover effects.},

The relationship between the concepts is not made explicit in literature, which is blurring their conceptual contours and constrains the efficacy of using the approaches in research and practice. This research addresses this gap and aims to provide conceptual clarity by distinguishing the terms and synthesising the different types of relationships between them. We conducted an extensive literature review, employing bibliometric analysis and snowballing techniques to investigate the state of the art in the field and synthesise the similarities, differences and relationships between both terms.

abstract = {Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) has generated great interest as one of the most innovative materials being developed for a wide range of applications. The polymer is thermoplastic and biodegradable, which makes it highly attractive for biological and medical applications. It can be transformed by spinning into filaments for subsequent fabrication of desirable textile structures. Spinning may be accomplished by various routes, each with its merits and demerits. The medical applications of this polymer arise from its biocompatibility: the degradation product, lactic acid, is metabolically innocuous. The fibers may be fabricated into various forms and may be used for implants and other surgical applications such as sutures. Tissue engineering is the most recent domain where poly(lactic acid) is being used and is found to be one of the most favorable matrix materials. The present article presents a critical review on the production of poly(lactic acid) fiber by various methods, along with correlations between structure and properties of the fibers. The applications of these fibers in various domains are also discussed.},

abstract = {Systematic studies have been carried out on two different powder materials used for additive manufacturing: stainless steel and cobalt-chrome. The characterization of these powders is important in NIST efforts to develop appropriate measurements and standards for additive materials and to document the property of powders used in a NIST-led additive manufacturing material round robin. An extensive array of characterization techniques was applied to these two powders, in both virgin and recycled states. The physical techniques included laser diffraction particle size analysis, X-ray computed tomography for size and shape analysis, and optical and scanning electron microscopy. Techniques sensitive to chemistry, including X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive analytical X-ray analysis using the X-rays generated during scanning electron microscopy, were also employed. Results of these analyses will be used to shed light on the question: how does virgin powder change after being exposed to and recycled from one or more additive manufacturing build cycles? In addition, these findings can give insight into the actual additive manufacturing process. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Purpose: The paper aims to investigate the problem of heat distribution in FDM 3D printing. The temperature distribution of the material is important because of the occurrence of shrinkage and crystallization phenomena that affect the dimensional accuracy and strength of the material. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a thermoplastic material (polylactide) and a test stand equipped with a 3D printer adapted to perform thermographic observations. The main source of heat in the study was a molten laminate material and a hot-end head. Findings: When the material is molten at the temperature of 190°C, the temperature of a previous layer increases above the glass transition point (Tg = 64.8°C) and reaches to about 80°C. In addition, at the boundary of the layers, there occurs a permanent bonding of the consecutive layers because of their partial melting. The paper also reports the results of porosity of PLA samples printed at the temperature ranging between 205 and 255°C. The degree of porosity depends on the temperature of the extruded material. Practical implications: The results may be helpful for designers of various printed parts and construction engineers of printing heads and 3D printer chambers. Originality/value: Thermograms of material layers with a height of 0.3 mm are obtained using a thermal imaging camera with a lens for macro magnification (43 pixels/mm).},

abstract = {Used products recycling is a cleaner and greener mode of production. The multiple uncertainties in the process of recycling and reproduction require appropriate government regulation. On the basis of classical game theory, the positive influence of cooperative social reputation is also considered, and a dynamic Stackelberg game model dominated by manufacturers is constructed. The comparison of the total market demand for products, the number of used products recycled and the recycle rate of used products can be obtained under four different scenarios. In addition to the business as usual (BAU) scenario, any kind of scenarios represent the corresponding regulatory policy. The results show that, with respect to the BAU scenario, the penalty scenario and the reward-penalty scenario have a positive correlation with the recycling rate of used products, while the reward scenario has a negative correlation with the recycling rate. The impact of the reward-penalty scenario on the total market demand for products, cooperative social reputation and the number of used products recycled is related to the specified recycling rate, set by the government. In the end, the validity of the model is verified through numerical simulation and the sensitivity of the relevant parameters under the reward-penalty scenario are analysed. The conclusion of this paper is of great significance for designing precise policies to promote recycling of used products.},

In this paper, we aim to investigate the impact of components' deterioration profiles and consumers' repair decisions on the lifespan of devices, and then assesse the anticipated life cycle environmental impacts. A Monte Carlo simulation is developed to estimate the life cycle characteristics such as the average lifespan, the number of failed components' replacement, and the total repair cost per cycle for a laptop computer. The lifecycle characteristics estimated from simulation model further have been used in a life cycle assessment (LCA) study to quantify the environmental impact associated with different design scenarios. The results reveal the impact of product design as well as consumers' repair decisions on the product lifespan and the corresponding environmental impacts.},

abstract = {Through reduced 3-D printer cost, increased usability, and greater material selection, additive manufacturing has transitioned from business manufacturing to the average prosumer. This study serves as a representative model for the potential future of 3-D printing in the average American household by employing a printer operator who was relatively unfamiliar with 3-D printing and the 3-D design files of common items normally purchased by the average consumer. Twenty-six items were printed in thermoplastic and a cost analysis was performed through comparison to comparable, commercially available products at a low and high price range. When compared to the low-cost items, investment in a 3-D printer represented a return of investment of over 100{\%} in five years. The simple payback time for the high-cost comparison was less than 6 months, and produced a 986{\%} return. Thus, fully-assembled commercial open source 3-D printers can be highly profitable investments for American consumers. Finally, as a preliminary gauge of the effect that widespread prosumer use of 3-D printing might have on the economy, savings were calculated based on the items' download rates from open repositories. Results indicate that printing these selected items have already saved prosumers over {\$}4 million by substituting for purchases.},

abstract = {In nowadays, there are a large number of regions in the world facing with double pressures of ecological fragility and economic poverty. In these regions, if human choose traditional development mode to constantly exploited natural resources for developing economy, the environment will be hardly destroyed or polluted, and finally cause larger economic loss and make poverty more serious. It formed a development dilemma of environmental fragility-economic poverty vicious circle (FPVC). How to break FPVC has been the goal being pursued in the literature worldwide. In this study, we constructed a Circular-Economy-Effect-and-Policy-Simulation-System-Dynamics (CEEPS-SD) model, evaluated the ecological economic comprehensive effects and simulated the future development trends of the circular economy system (CES) which we have planned, constantly tracked and improved in Anding District of Northwest China for 16 years, that is a typical FPVC area. The evaluation and simulation results notably evidenced that the CES had four ecological economic benefits: livestock faeces pollution elimination, water saving, agricultural waste recycling, as well as energy conservation and emission reduction. Through long-term and stable operation, the CES can expand its ecological economic comprehensive benefits constantly and finally eliminate the double pressures of ecological fragility and economic poverty. This study could help large number similar FPVC areas in the world to scientifically build, manage, evaluate, simulate and optimize CES for getting rid of FPVC and achieving sustainable development, which has important theoretical significance and practical value.},

abstract = {Valorisation of the urban plastic waste in high-quality recyclates is an imperative challenge in the new paradigm of the circular economy. In this scenario, a key role in the improvement of the recycling process is exerted by the optimization of waste sorting. In spite of the enormous developments achieved in the field of automated sorting systems, the quest for the reduction of cross-contamination of incompatible polymers as well as a rapid and punctual sorting of the unmatched polymers has not been sufficiently developed. In this paper, we demonstrate that a miniaturized handheld near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer can be used to successfully fingerprint and classify different plastic polymers. The investigated urban plastic waste comprised polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and poly(styrene) (PS), collected directly in a recycling plastic waste plant, without any kind of sample washing or treatment. The application of unsupervised and supervised chemometric tools such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) on the NIR dataset resulted in a complete classification of the polymer classes. In addition, several kinds of PET (clear, blue, coloured, opaque, and boxes) were correctly classified as PET class, and PE samples with different branching degrees were properly separated.},

abstract = {Advancement of the digital economy has transformed the concept of the growth crossover in nations and firms, both concerning input and output. Advanced economies have been confronting a dilemma between input increases and output decreases. Contrary to traditional expectations, excessive increase in input has resulted in a productivity decline in output. A solution to this dilemma can only be expected by harnessing the vigor of soft innovation resources that lead to neo open innovation in the digital economy. This paper attempts to demonstrate this hypothetical view. Based on an empirical analysis of the development trajectories of 140 countries and 500 global ICT firms, dynamism, resulting in bipolarization between a virtuous cycle and a vicious cycle between input increases and productivity enhancement, was discovered. Furthermore, an empirical analysis focusing on the development trajectories of two world ICT leaders, Finland and Singapore, identified a mechanism of neo open innovation that assimilates soft innovation resources into a national production system. This mechanism can substitute for research and development (R{\&}D) and removes structural impediments to growth while providing relief from the increasing burden of R{\&}D investment. The above findings provide insightful suggestions for drafting a roadmap towards neo open innovation in the digital economy.},

abstract = {Industrial green development (IGD) is a critical response to the over-consumption of natural resources and pollution caused by modern industry. Innovation-driven IGD has generated great interest in recent years. However, relatively less attention has been paid to the various aspects of IGD and the moderating role of regional factors, including the developmental stage of IGD, government-scale, and enterprise-scale. The present study was conducted to fill these research gaps using panel data across 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2015. The empirical results show that 1) innovation does promote IGD and is most effective in low-carbon production, followed by resource reduction, economic operation, and pollution abatement; 2) there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the regional IGD level and the role of innovation in IGD; and 3) both government-scale and enterprise-scale contribute to the innovation-driven IGD. These findings provide new insights into the impact of innovation on IGD and may shed light on future decisions related to green development.},

Based on this research work, it is shown that patient-specific model based on computed tomography data can be converted into computer numerically controlled G-code. It is shown that 3D extrusion-based additive manufacturing technology is accurate to ±3 {\%} equating to ±200 $\mu$m surface deviations due to plastic shrinkage and distortion formed during the process. Polylactic acid plastic extrusion through a 200-$\mu$m bore nozzle has resulted in a model being produced with an R a roughness of 35.5 $\mu$m. An evaluation on the errors generated during the fabrication process has been used to accurately produce an adult female mandible. Internal nerve channels and complex external bone geometry has been produced within the model. It is shown that using this process results in bone complexity and accuracy required for producing low-cost surgical grades models which is in comparison with traditional selective laser sintering manufacturing techniques.

abstract = {Fused deposition modelling is a rapidly growing additive manufacturing technology due to its ability to build functional parts having complex geometries. The mechanical properties of a built part depend on several process parameters. The aim of this study is to characterize the effect of build orientation, layer thickness and feed rate on the mechanical performance of PLA samples manufactured with a low cost 3D printer. Tensile and three-point bending tests are carried out to determine the mechanical response of the printed specimens. Due to the layer-by-layer process, 3D printed samples exhibit anisotropic behaviour. Upright orientation shows the lowest mechanical properties. On the other hand, on-edge and flat orientation show the highest strength and stiffness. From a layer thickness and feed rate point of view, it is observed that ductility decreases as layer thickness and feed rate increase. In addition, the mechanical properties increase as layer thickness increases and decrease as the feed rate increases for the upright orientation. However, the variations in mechanical properties with layer thickness and feed rate are of slight significance for on-edge and flat orientations, except in the particular case of low layer thickness. Finally, the practicality of the results is assessed by testing an evaluation structure.},

The many challenges that surround this new manufacturing technology fall into several different categories. The paper addresses one of these categories, the physical mechanisms that control the additive manufacturing process. Physical mechanisms control the effects of processing parameters on microstructures and properties of additively manufactured parts. Some mechanisms might not have been recognized, yet, and for those that are currently known, detailed quantitative predictions have to be established. The physical mechanisms of metal additive manufacturing are firmly grounded in metallurgy, branching into laser physics and the physics of granular materials. Powder bed additive manufacturing is described from the powder storage to post-processing and elements of metallurgy are highlighted that are relevant for the different aspects of the additive manufacturing process. These elements include the surface reactions on powder particles, the heating and melting behavior of the powder bed, solidification, and post-processing. This overview of the different metallurgical aspects to additive manufacturing is intended to help guide research efforts and it will also serve as a snapshot of the current understanding of powder bed additive manufacturing. 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {In recent times, the issue of plastic recycling has become one of the leading issues of environmental protection and waste management. Polymer materials have been found an application in many areas of daily life and industry. Along with their extended use, the problem of plastic wastes appeared because, after withdrawal from use, they became persistent and noxious wastes. The possibility of reusing polymeric materials gives a possibility of valorization-a second life-and enables effective waste utilization to obtain consumable products. The 3D printing market is a well-growing sector. Printable filaments can be made from a variety of thermoplastic materials, including those from recycling. This paper focuses on a review of the available literature on the production of filaments for 3D printers from recycled polymers as the alternative to present approach of central selective collection of plastics. The possibility of recycling of basic thermoplastic materials and the impact of processing on their physicochemical and mechanical properties were verified (Lanzotti et al. 2019). In addition, commercially available filaments produced from recycled materials and devices which allow self-production of filaments to 3D printing from plastic waste were reviewed.},

abstract = {The objective of this report is to propose comprehensive guidelines for systematic literature reviews appropriate for software engineering researchers, including PhD students. A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

abstract = {Plastics have transformed everyday life; usage is increasing and annual production is likely to exceed 300 million tonnes by 2010. In this concluding paper to the Theme Issue on Plastics, the Environment and Human Health, we synthesize current understanding of the benefits and concerns surrounding the use of plastics and look to future priorities, challenges and opportunities. It is evident that plastics bring many societal benefits and offer future technological and medical advances. However, concerns about usage and disposal are diverse and include accumulation of waste in landfills and in natural habitats, physical problems for wildlife resulting from ingestion or entanglement in plastic, the leaching of chemicals from plastic products and the potential for plastics to transfer chemicals to wildlife and humans. However, perhaps the most important overriding concern, which is implicit throughout this volume, is that our current usage is not sustainable. Around 4 per cent of world oil production is used as a feedstock to make plastics and a similar amount is used as energy in the process. Yet over a third of current production is used to make items of packaging, which are then rapidly discarded. Given our declining reserves of fossil fuels, and finite capacity for disposal of waste to landfill, this linear use of hydrocarbons, via packaging and other short-lived applications of plastic, is simply not sustainable. There are solutions, including material reduction, design for end-of-life recyclability, increased recycling capacity, development of bio-based feedstocks, strategies to reduce littering, the application of green chemistry life-cycle analyses and revised risk assessment approaches. Such measures will be most effective through the combined actions of the public, industry, scientists and policymakers. There is some urgency, as the quantity of plastics produced in the first 10 years of the current century is likely to approach the quantity produced in the entire century that preceded.},

abstract = {Agrochemical containers shall undergo decontamination before being considered for recycling. This study provides an assessment on the feasibility of the triple-rinsing decontamination procedure, while evaluating the appropriateness of the material's quality for recycling. To achieve the objectives of the study, (1) the effectiveness of the decontamination procedure was investigated; (2) containers´ long storage times and changes on the polymer´s structure were assessed; and (3) the quality of the recycled material was tested. Results showed that the triple-rinsing procedure was ineffective for the container´s complete decontamination, yet a further washing step – performed during the simulation of the recycling process – allowed for an improved degree of decontamination for recycling. Photo-oxidation imposed significant changes on the chemical structure of the polymer, where the active ingredient could be detected by FTIR, even after the application of rinsing and extraction. The chemical structure of the bulk material has not changed, indicating that the pesticide mobilization was only confined to the surface. The mechanical tests showed material quality appropriateness, where tensile strength values were within the suggested ranges, providing a possibility for further utilization of this material when appropriate decontamination is applied.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the online recycling model becomes increasingly popular. More and more firms are gradually conducting a model with both offline and online recycling channels. Unfortunately, few works in the literature concern about it. Taking the random demand of remanufactured products into consideration, we establish a theoretical model in which the remanufacturer plays as a game leader and the recycler acts as a follower. We study three recycling channel models, namely a single offline recycling channel (Model A), a single online recycling channel (Model B) and mixed recycling channels (Model C). We obtain the optimal pricing and recycling quantities decisions, as well as the corresponding profits. Results show that the mixed recycling channels model can help reduce the transferring price under some conditions and force the recycler to raise the recycling price. As a result, the introduction of an online recycling channel can always benefit the remanufacturer but hurt the recycler. Furthermore, regarding the reverse supply chain system, we uncover that the introduction of an online channel can be beneficial or harmful. In particular, the mixed recycling channels model may be worse off than the single offline recycling channel model under a specific condition.},

It is applicable the thermal analysis such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), spectroscopic analysis such as Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and morphological analysis such as scanning electronic microscope (SEM). The analysis results show that RPP from waste-appliances is the polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) copolymer enhanced impact property (Impact-PP) and it is possible to apply refrigerator plastics with good impact property at low temperature. Finally, the performance evaluation of RPP is estimated by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) analysis and is performed by the various mechanical and physical testing methods. It shows that RPP has relatively high molecular weight and balanced properties with strength and toughness. It is expected that RPP by the mechanical recycling from waste-appliances will have about 50{\%} cost-merit. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A growing body of literature argues that an organization's management control needs to adapt as an organization changes business model or strategy for the management control to be consistent with the organization's objectives and strategies. Nevertheless, scepticism has been raised about the role of management controls in promoting sustainability or the circular economy within organizations. Based on the management control framework of Malmi and Brown (2008), this paper explores empirically how organizations work with the circular economy and how management control has adapted to the business model. The results show that the circular economy can be practiced in different ways and that the adaptation and application of the circular economy affects the whole management control package. The paper identifies the importance of cultural control and long-range planning for communicating circular values and spreading a culture based on circular principles. However, regardless of what circular strategies are used, circular work tends to steer attention to the early phases of the product life cycle. For management controls this means that action plans, cost accounting, and investment appraisals must reflect a higher level of detail and a longer time horizon. The paper highlights how this is associated with challenges for traditional management controls.},

abstract = {Sustainability assessment of biodiesel production is a topic of increasing importance due to the interest of governments to define sovereignty strategies and diversification of their energy matrix, and to set up the impact of biofuels production. In this context, this work aims to propose a hierarchical structure of sustainability assessment that integrates dimensions of sustainable development with principles, criteria and indicators (PC{\&}I). The method employed to define the hierarchical structure was a comprehensive literature review, based on information search strategy and classification. About 400 documents were reviewed and 103 documents were ultimately selected, including laws, policy documents, certificates, directives and other normative documents and papers published in peer-reviewed journals. The first result of the analysis was the need to strengthen identification of the sustainable development assessment, adding the political and technological dimensions to the three traditional dimensions, social, economic and environmental, studied in this kind of evaluation. The second result was the proposal of a hierarchical framework for the sustainability assessment of biodiesel production, organized in four levels: The first level comprises the five dimensions associated with sustainable development evaluation, the second includes 13 principles, the third contains 40 criteria and the fourth level corresponds to a set of indicators that describes each criterion. Outcomes of this work provide a foundation for further discussion of sustainability assessments for biodiesel production and its potential application in specific contexts.},

abstract = {Manufacturing systems evolution is afunction in multiple external and internal factors. With today's global awareness of environmental risks as well as the pressing needs to compete through efficiency, manufacturing systems are evolving into a new paradigm. This paper presents a system model for the new green manufacturing paradigm. The model captures various planning activities to migrate from a less green into a greener and more eco-efficient manufacturing. The various planning stages are accompanied by the required control metrics as well as various green tools in an open mixed architecture. The system model is demonstrated by an industrial case study. The proposed model is a comprehensive qualitative answer to the question of how to design and/or improve green manufacturing systems as well as a roadmap for future quantitative research to better evaluate this new paradigm. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Applying LOM in rapid tooling and patternmaking is especially advantageous because of the LOM objects' robustness, their wood-like properties and their comparably low material costs. Possible fields of application are shown in the following. Explicit application examples in sand casting, investment casting and ceramics processing show how a reduction of necessary process steps and cycle times can be achieved by the application of LOM models. To gain this the control of the LOM objects' accuracy and stability during different secondary processes is of decisive importance.},

abstract = {Purpose - Company pressure for manufacturers is mounting from two angles: Increasing pressure of global competition, and rapid advancements in technology such as additive manufacturing (AM) that are altering the way that goods are manufactured. The purpose of this paper is to explore the adoption process of AM within a manufacturing system and its business impact. Design/methodology/approach - Research was conducted to collect empirical data at two manufacturing case companies in the North West England. Both cases are located in areas of industrial recovery using AM engineering innovation for value creation. Findings - Early findings showed that the implementation of AM caused a shift in value propositions and the creation of additional value streams (VSs) for the case study companies. AM was shown to compliment and strengthen traditional manufacturing VSs rather than replacing them. Research limitations/implications - Limitations include the generalizability due to the number and location of case companies included in this research. Practical implications - It is worthwhile to explore the opportunities that AM brings with the existing customer base as it has the potential to add unexplored and untapped value. However, managers need to be mindful of the capability and resources required to put the VS into practice. Social implications - Both cases resulted in skill retainment and development due to the implementation of AM. Hence, the innovation contributed to regional economic recovery and business survival. Originality/value - This empirical research is one of the early field explorations focussing on the impact of AM on VS structures. Hence, this paper contributes to the area of technology enhanced manufacturing systems.},

Further, multi-material 3DP has the potentials to be a milestone in rapid manufacturing (RM), customized design and structural applications. Being compatible as functionally graded materials in a single structural form, multi-material-based 3D printed parts can be applied in structural applications to get the benefit of modified properties. Design/methodology/approach-The fused deposition modelling (FDM) is one of the established low cost 3DP techniques which can be used for printing functional/ non-functional prototypes in civil engineering applications. Findings-The present study is focused on multi-material printing of primary recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA) and high impact polystyrene (HIPS) in composite form. Thermal (glass transition temperature and heat capacity) and mechanical properties (break load, break strength, break elongation, percentage elongation at break and Young's modulus) have been analysed to observe the behaviour of multi-material composites prepared by 3DP. This study also highlights the process parameters optimization of FDM supported with photomicrographs.

@article{Nascimento2019,
abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore how rising technologies from Industry 4.0 can be integrated with circular economy (CE) practices to establish a business model that reuses and recycles wasted material such as scrap metal or e-waste. Design/methodology/approach The qualitative research method was deployed in three stages. Stage 1 was a literature review of concepts, successful factors and barriers related to the transition towards a CE along with sustainable supply chain management, smart production systems and additive manufacturing (AM). Stage 2 comprised a conceptual framework to integrate and evaluate the synergistic potential among these concepts. Finally, stage 3 validated the proposed model by collecting rich qualitative data based on semi-structured interviews with managers, researchers and professors of operations management to gather insightful and relevant information. Findings The outcome of the study is the recommendation of a circular model to reuse scrap electronic devices, integrating web technologies, reverse logistics and AM to support CE practices. Results suggest a positive influence from improving business sustainability by reinserting waste into the supply chain to manufacture products on demand. Social implications The purpose of this study was to explore how Industry 4.0 technologies are integrated with CE practices. This allows for the proposal of a circular business model for recycling waste and delivering new products, significantly reducing resource consumption and optimising natural resources. In a first stage, the circular business model can be used to recycle electronic scrap, with the proposed integration of web technologies, reverse logistics and AM as a technological platform to support the model. These have several environmental, sociotechnical and economic implications for society. Originality/value The sociotechnical aspects are directly impacted by the circular smart production system (CSPS) management model, since it creates a new culture of reuse and recycling techniques for urban waste using 3D printing technologies, as well as Industry 4.0 concepts to increase production on demand and automate manufacturing processes. The tendency of the CSPS model is to contribute to deployment CE in the manufacture of new products or parts with AM approaches, generating a new path of supply and demand for society.},

The aerospace industry employs them because of the possibility of manufacturing lighter structures to reduce weight. Additive manufacturing is transforming the practice of medicine and making work easier for architects. In 2004, the Society of Manufacturing Engineers did a classification of the various technologies and there are at least four additional significant technologies in 2012. Studies are reviewed which were about the strength of products made in additive manufacturing processes. However, there is still a lot of work and research to be accomplished before additive manufacturing technologies become standard in the manufacturing industry because not every commonly used manufacturing material can be handled.

abstract = {3D printer manufacturers have been focussing on maintaining their market position considering the ever-changing demands for new product designs. The recent boom in the household 3D-printer market raises the question of whether it is a good idea to produce large numbers of household 3D-printers, considering that the satisfaction with the visuals printed by 3D-printers will not remain stable. Changing desires leads prosumers to revise their printed forms, frequently making another design to overcome dissatisfaction. Quick disposal of these successive printed forms creates a significant amount of waste. It was hypothesised that it is not possible to meet the sustainable waste management goals with the increase in household-level 3D-printers. Therefore, the use of 3D-printers is likely to be unsustainable because of this expected substantial increase in waste. This study conducted a literature review to provide a perspective on this phenomenon. The novel contribution of this perspective will help estimate the amount of waste generated. It was concluded that 3D-printers, although help in meeting the everyday desires of prosumers, do not meet the requirements of a sustainable society.},

The obtained recycling-based polyol was subjected to analytical, physicochemical and spectroscopic tests (FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR) to confirm its suitability for the synthesis of polyurethane materials. Then, it was used to partially replace petrochemical polyol in polyurethane formulation. The obtained RPU/PIR foams were characterized by lower apparent density, brittleness, and water absorption. In addition, foams modified by eco-polyol had higher flame retardancy, as compared to reference foam. The results of the research show that the use of PLA polyol based on plastic waste may be an alternative to petrochemical polyols. This research matches with the current trends of sustainable development and green chemistry.},

abstract = {Matrices or look-up tables are increasingly popular flexible tools for ecosystem services mapping and assessment. The matrix approach links ecosystem types or land cover types to ecosystem services by providing a score for ecosystem service (ES) capacity, supply, use, demand or other concepts. Using expert elicitation enables quick and integrative ES scoring that can meet general demand for validated ES mapping and assessment at different scales. Nevertheless, guidance is needed on how to collect and integrate expert knowledge to address some of the biases and limits of the expert elicitation method. This paper aims to propose a set of guidelines to produce ES matrices based on expert knowledge. It builds on existing literature and experience acquired through the production of several ES matrices in several ES assessments carried out in France. We propose a 7- steps methodology for the expert-based matrix approach that aims to promote cogency in the method and coherency in the matrices produced. The aim here is to use collective knowledge to produce semi-quantitative estimates of ES quantities and not to analyse individual or societal preferences or importance of ES. The definition of the objectives and the preparation phase is particularly important in order to define the components of capacity to demand ES chain to be addressed. The objectives and the ES components addressed will influence the composition of the expert panel. We recommend an individual filling of an empty matrix in order to strengthen the statistical analysis of the scores' variability and the analysis of congruency between experts. Expert scoring should follow a process of discussion, information-sharing and collective appropriation of a list of ecosystem types and ES to be assessed. We suggest that the ES matrix should not only focus on ES central scores but also address the variabilities and uncertainties as part of the ES assessment. The analysis of these sources of variability allows the documentation of variations in the ES quantity but also an exploration into the lack of consensus or knowledge gaps that needs to be addressed.},

@article{Hage2008,
abstract = {The Swedish producer responsibility ordinance mandates producers to collect and recycle packaging materials. This paper investigates the main determinants of collection rates of household plastic packaging waste in Swedish municipalities. This is done by the use of a regression analysis based on cross-sectional data for 252 Swedish municipalities. The results suggest that local policies, geographic/demographic variables, socio-economic factors and environmental preferences all help explain inter-municipality collection rates. For instance, the collection rate appears to be positively affected by increases in the unemployment rate, the share of private houses, and the presence of immigrants (unless newly arrived) in the municipality. The impacts of distance to recycling industry, urbanization rate and population density on collection outcomes turn out, though, to be both statistically and economically insignificant. A reasonable explanation for this is that the monetary compensation from the material companies to the collection entrepreneurs vary depending on region and is typically higher in high-cost regions. This implies that the plastic packaging collection in Sweden may be cost ineffective. Finally, the analysis also shows that municipalities that employ weight-based waste management fees generally experience higher collection rates than those municipalities in which flat and/or volume-based fees are used. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Second, the Commons-oriented wind turbine examined here is also meant to practically contribute to the quest for novel solutions to the timely problem of the need for (autonomous) renewable sources of energy, more in the sense of a development process than as a ready-to-apply solution. We demonstrate that it is possible for someone with partial initial knowledge to initiate a similar, complex project based on an interesting idea, and to succeed in implementing it through collaboration with Commons-oriented communities, while using peer-produced products and tools. Given the trends and trajectories both of the current information-based paradigm and the problems of the predominant industrial modes of production with all the collateral damage they entail, this may be considered a positive message indeed.},

Our findings are that while fab labs and makerspaces naturally foster some entrepreneurial 21st century skills, only explicit and proactive entrepreneurship and education programme enable to foster the whole spectrum of these skills. In regard to technical skills, fab labs and makerspaces enable to develop skills beyond what is generally considered as 21st century digital skills, because they combine digital skills with hands-on ‘making' skills, since they are themselves mixed environment, both digital and physical. Consequently, the growing importance of ‘maker technologies' may force to redefine what 21st century skills should be.},

abstract = {As a growing number of companies reject intellectual property (IP) monopoly-based business models to embrace libre product development of free and open source hardware and software, there is an urgent need to refurbish the instruments of university-corporate research partnerships. These partnerships generally use a proprietary standard research agreement (PSRA), which for historical reasons contains significant IP monopoly language and restrictions for both the company and the university. Such standard research agreements thus create an artificial barrier to innovation as both companies using a libre model and universities they wish to collaborate with must invest significantly to restructure the contracts. To solve this problem, this article provides a new Sponsored Libre Research Agreement (SLRA). The differences between the agreements are detailed. The advantages of using an SLRA are provided for any type of company and include: (1) minimizing research investments on reporting requirements; (2) reducing delays related to confidentiality and publication embargos; and (3) reducing both transaction and legal costs as well as research time losses associated with IP. Moving to libre agreements both speeds up and reduces costs for setting up collaborative research. Under the SLRA, university researchers can spend more time innovating for the same investment.},

abstract = {One of the hot topics currently in manufacturing domain is direct digital manufacturing. With introduction of cheap three-dimensional printers, the direct digital manufacturing seems to become a new manufacturing paradigm with an entirely different impact on society; nevertheless how this will impact the society and the differences between the paradigms are unclear. According to this background, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of direct digital manufacturing from different perspectives in comparison to various traditional manufacturing paradigms. Authors are using a societal viewpoint to see, describe and analyse the subject instead of traditional manufacturing viewpoint. For the better understanding of direct digital manufacturing origins, a classification and historical background about available techniques are described. Furthermore, direct digital manufacturing as a paradigm is analysed and compared with craft production, mass production and mass customisation. Direct digital manufacturing's sustainability aspects related to social, economical and environmental dimensions are gathered and analysed for a better insight of this technique. A detailed case study demonstrates the energy use differences of direct digital manufacturing and mass production in depth. According to the present work, direct digital manufacturing has the possibility of combining the advantages of the other production paradigms and can have a positive impact on sustainable development; yet, there are several challenges to overcome both in technical and sociality aspects. A challenge within the social aspects can be the life style changes which can impact the job market, working environment, waste management and more.},

abstract = {To facilitate optimal application of appropriate scaffold architectures for clinical trials, there is a need to compare different scaffold modifications under similar experimental conditions. In this study was assessed the effectiveness of poly-e-caprolactone (PCL) scaffolds fabricated by fused deposition modelling (FDM), with varying material modifications, for the purposes of bone tissue engineering. The incorporation of hydroxyapatite (HA) in PCL scaffolds, as well as precalcification through immersion in a simulated body fluid (SBF) to produce a biomimetic apatite coating on the scaffolds, was assessed. A series of in vitro studies spanning 3 weeks as well as in vivo studies utilizing a subcutaneous nude mouse model were carried out. PCL and HA-PCL scaffolds demonstrated increasing tissue growth extending throughout the implants, as well as superior mechanical strength and mineralization, as evidenced by X-ray imaging after 14 weeks in vivo. No significant difference was found between PCL and HA-PCL scaffolds. Precalcification with SBF did not result in increased osteoconductivity and cell proliferation as previously reported. Conversely, tensile forces exerted by tissue sheets bridging adjacent struts of the PCL scaffold caused flaking of the apatite coating that resulted in impaired cell attachment, growth and mineralization. The results suggest that scaffolds fabricated by FDM may have load-bearing applications.},

Although entrepreneurial orientation holds the key for entrepreneurial success, research on how entrepreneurial orientation impacts the relationship between grassroots innovation (GRI) and entrepreneurial success is critical. This research is still in its infancy and has not adequately been addressed. This study endeavors to fill this gap while examining how the three factors of grassroots innovation such as new grassroots learning practices, local solution and networking capabilities influence entrepreneurial orientation enroute to affecting economic benefits and non-economic benefits from entrepreneurial activity. The study involved data from 400 grassroots innovators and a structural equation modeling approach was used to fit the data based on the aforementioned factors and components. The study reveals that entrepreneurial orientation is observed to fully mediate the relationship between the following three linear dependencies: new grassroots learning practices and economic benefits, networking capabilities and economic benefits, and local solution and non-economic benefits. This study also found that entrepreneurial orientation partially mediates the relationship in the following cases: new grassroots learning practices and non-economic benefits, networking capabilities and non-economic benefits, and local solution and economic benefits. The results provide empirical evidence to support that entrepreneurial orientation spurred by grassroots innovation significantly influence entrepreneurial success in the Indian context.},

abstract = {Concerns over climate change and the security of industrial feedstock supplies have been opening a growing market for biobasedmaterials. This development, however, also presents a challenge to scientists, policy makers, and industry because the production of biobased materials requires land and is typically associated with adverse environmental effects. This article addresses the environmental impacts of biobased materials in a meta-analysis of 44 life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. The reviewed literature suggests that one metric ton (t) of biobased materials saves, relative to conventional materials, 55±34 gigajoules of primary energy and 3 ± 1 t carbon dioxide equivalents of greenhouse gases. However, biobased materials may increase eutrophication by 5 ± 7 kilograms (kg) phosphate equivalents/t and stratospheric ozone depletion by 1.9 ± 1.8 kg nitrous oxide equivalents/t. Our findings are inconclusive with regard to acidification (savings of 2 ± 20 kg sulfur dioxide equivalents/t) and photochemical ozone formation (savings of 0.3 ± 2.4 kg ethene equivalents/t). The variability in the results of life cycle assessment studies highlights the difficulties in drawing general conclusions. Still, common to most biobased materials are impacts caused by the application of fertilizers and pesticides during industrial biomass cultivation. Additional land use impacts, such as the potential loss of biodiversity, soil carbon depletion, soil erosion, deforestation, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from indirect land use change are not quantified in this review. Clearly these impacts should be considered when evaluating the environmental performance of biobased materials.},

abstract = {The study of cities, or urban systems, in Industrial Ecology has a peculiar history. In the 1960s, there was a false dawn for green cities in the United States under the Experimental City project, the unfulfi lled plans for which included numer-ous aspects of Industrial Ecology (IE). When IE eventually began to form as a dis-cipline in the 1990s, cities or urban systems were at best a fringe topic, although their importance was recognized by thought leaders in the fi eld. The development of research on cities as a theme within IE perhaps followed with the broadening of IE to include Social Ecology. Then the study of urban metabolism, which had its own separate literature, arguably became one of the three metabolisms within IE – along with industrial and socio-economic. In this review of work on IE and cities, a Scopus search of ISI-rated publications fi nds over 200 papers on the topic, many of which are in the Journal of Industrial Ecology . Amongst the common themes are papers on urban industrial symbiosis, urban infrastructure frameworks, transportation, waste, energy, greenhouse gas emissions, other urban contaminants, metals, phos-phorus and food in cities. The great ongoing challenge for work on IE and cities remains to understand the environmental impacts related to urban metabolism and attempt to reduce them. More specifi c examples of possible future work include determining potentials for city-scale industrial symbiosis and uncovering how much is occurring and exploring theoretical limits to the sustainability of cities using non-equilibrium thermodynamics.},

Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This research considered system-wide relationships that enabled lean tools to aid waste reduction in industrial processes in a multicultural workplace environment in organisations that previously committed to Lean practices. Ten categories of waste prevalent in industry were categorised into manufacturing, non-manufacturing and well-being. Seven case studies from five companies were conducted which sought to establish the relationship between lean tools and waste in their processes. The study was based on interviews that highlighted the positive and negative impacts that lean tools have on waste. The study generally found a strong connectivity between lean tools and manufacturing waste reduction. However, the key performance indicators (KPIs) tool increased non-manufacturing waste and six lean tools increased well-being waste. Additionally, the findings indicate that some tools can be counter-productive to waste reduction in an industrial system when non-manufacturing and well-being are taken into account. Lean tools were resilient enough that implementation in multicultural workplaces, even with transient populations, did not influence waste generation.},

To understand the fate of electronic waste after collection and recycling, a products and materials flow analysis should be performed. This is a critical need, as material resources are becoming increasingly scarce and recycling may be able to provide secondary sources for new materials in the future. In this study, we investigate electronic waste systems, specifically the resource recovery or recycling aspects, as well as mapping electronic waste flows based on collection data in France. Approximately 1,588,453 t of new electrical and electronic equipment were sold in the French market in 2010. Of this amount, 430,000 t of electronic waste were collected, with the remaining 1,128,444 t remaining in stock. Furthermore, the total recycled amounts were 354,106 t and 11,396 t, respectively. The main electronic waste materials were ferrous metals (37{\%}), plastic (22{\%}), aluminium (12{\%}), copper (11{\%}) and glass (7{\%}).

abstract = {Plastics are widely used because of their diverse mechanical and physicochemical properties, however, many plastic products can only achieve their specific characteristics if mixed with additives, like flame retardants, stabilizers, and plasticizers. Some of the formerly used plastic additives, however, are in the meantime evaluated as substances of very high concern (SVHC) or even persistent organic pollutants (POP) and are referred to as “legacy additives”. Therefore, the improper disposal of legacy plastic waste as well as the recycling and reuse of such can lead to continuous circulation of harmful additives into the environment, threatening plant and animal life, and human health. The environmental threats posed by hazardous additives have been addressed by international regulations like the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) regulation and the Stockholm Convention. They set thresholds for hazardous chemicals including some legacy additives, which regulate trading and waste management, and aim at a fast phase out of hazardous compounds. At the same time, governmental, non-governmental and industrial players support a circular economy of goods including plastics, which resulted and will further result in increasing recycling quotas for waste plastics. When it comes to plastics containing legacy additives a conflict of objectives may arise, namely saving polymeric resources versus phase-out of hazardous compounds. This review paper discusses legacy additives in plastic waste streams, their end-of-life treatment options related to legislation covering these additives and links between regulation and waste management.},

abstract = {This paper describes the fatigue behaviour of newly developed all-polypropylene (all-PP) tapes and composites, with reference to the composite processing conditions, testing temperature and making a comparison with commercial alternatives. All-PP tapes are highly oriented and their failure behaviour follows that of other highly oriented polymers. All-PP woven composites fail ultimately due to PP tape failure. However, this failure mode is accompanied by delamination of fabrics in the woven structure. Consolidation pressure plays a decisive role in controlling the interlaminar properties and hence the delamination resistance and furthermore the fatigue limit of the composite. Comparison of all-PP woven composites with commercial alternatives based on glass and natural fibres reveals the excellent relative performance of all-PP composites under fatigue loads. Fatigue properties of all-PP composites are however sensitive to the testing temperature, and elevated temperatures can lead to a rapid reduction of the fatigue resistance of these all-polymer systems.},

abstract = {The large amount of disposable bottles produced nowadays makes imperative the search for alternative procedures for recycling them since they are not biodegradable. This paper takes into consideration the thermomechanical recycling of post-consumed plastic bottles, especially the ones made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and their use as composite materials for engineering applications. As changes on the composite's microstructure can have an influence on macroscopic behavior, a new type of analysis is needed. To be able to evaluate the composite performance, a dual analysis procedure was developed. It consists of a micro-mechanical analysis where the microstructure is observed by optical microscopy, and variations in morphology are related to composite overall mechanical behavior. The macro-mechanical analysis is performed by ASTM D 3039/3039 M tensile tests. By doing this, the composite effective moduli can be determined. The new composite seems to be encouraging, i.e., an HDPE/PET composite with 40:60 ratio, in weight, experiments a stiffness recovery from the third to the fourth recycle. Moreover, the dual analysis was able to capture this variation. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

By considering the full spectrum of PLE practices systematically, we delineate these organizations on seven dimensions (i.e., key activities, key partners, channels, customer segments, customer relationships, offering, and revenue streaming) with 30 corresponding literature-based features. A clustering procedure, with key activities and key partners as input variables, revealed seven mutually exclusive PLEBMs: Relational product-as-a-service, Brick{\&}digital product nurturers, Quality product designers, Secondhand vendors, Marketer-managed access systems, and P2P access brokers.

The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and open-source design (including ‘open hardware'): how researchers contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself ‘making,' manufacturing and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues around open design community governance and ownership, safety and reliability of open outcomes require further investigation.},

The claim of this paper is that innovation is a highly challenging social and epistemological process which needs supporting (infra-)structures facilitating and enabling these processes. These processes have to take into account on various levels and domains in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner. It will be shown that innovation can no longer be understood as a mechanistic knowledge creation process. The concept of enabling will be developed as an alternative approach to innovation and will be applied as a design principle for Enabling Spaces.

By this approach, the tailored functionality of packaging concepts is created to sufficiently protect sensitive food products and thus obtain extended shelf life. However, because of their poor recyclability, most multilayers are usually incinerated or landfilled, counteracting the efforts towards a circular economy and crude oil independency. This review depicts the current state of the European multilayer packaging market and sketches the current end-of-life situation of postconsumer multilayer packaging waste in Germany. In the main section, a general overview of the state of research about material recycling of different multilayer packaging systems is provided. It is divided into two subsections, whereby one describes methods to achieve a separation of the different components, either by delamination or the selective dissolution–reprecipitation technique, and the other describes methods to achieve recycling by compatibilization of nonmiscible polymer types. While compatibilization methods and the technique of dissolution–reprecipitation are already extensively studied, the delamination of packaging has not been investigated systematically. All the presented options are able to recycle multilayer packaging, but also have drawbacks like a limited scope or a high expenditure of energy.},

abstract = {Digital manufacturing technologies are proliferating and can enable socially significant, innovative new forms of production and consumption. This thesis examines the environmental sustainability issues in peer production and how they are addressed in Fab Labs (fabrication laboratories): shared spaces where users can design and make their own artefacts outside of conventional mass production channels, using, for example, laser cutters, 3D printers and electronics stations. Fab Labs are open to members of the general public, who learn to use the equipment themselves and are encouraged (or required) to document and openly share their projects. ‘Making' in Fab Labs and the ‘maker movement' are often endorsed by proponents as a better alternative to mass consumption and consumerism, whether through enhancing skills to build and repair, answering one's own needs as opposed to ‘satisficing' through passive consumption, or distributing production within local networks as opposed to long, transport-intensive and large-volume supply chains. However, Fab Labs and makerspaces are contexts rife with paradox and complexity concerning appropriate use of materials and energy. Little empirical research on material peer production currently exists, and the environmental impacts, and benefits, of digital fabrication are largely unknown. Primarily through ethnographic research methods and Symbolic Interactionist analysis, the thesis examines daily practices and discourses in selected Fab Labs and how sustainability is represented in these communities. The findings articulate how the actors' interactions, expressed intents and contextual conditions serve to shape the Fab Lab. The key finding is the conflict actors encounter between – on the one hand – setting ambitions, promoting particular ideologies and espousing sustainability-oriented values, and – on the other hand – realizing and enacting these values in the mundane and constraining routines of everyday practice. Even actors with a clear ecological mandate struggle to engage with emerging sustainability issues in a rapidly changing sociotechnical environment. Present topics of concern and everyday tasks overshadow future strategy and vision work as well as engagement with environmental issues and rapid technology developments. However, actors who consciously and visibly strive to enact the espoused Fab Lab ideology, i.e. offering access to empowering, distributed technologies that enable people to meet their own local needs by design, appear better able to identify and tackle the environmental sustainability issues as they arise. Environmental issues are also intertwined with and embedded in other ideological concerns, but they are rarely promoted in their own right. The thesis also details the current landscape of research literature on distributed production, who is studying these environmental issues and how, and the potential opportunities and threats in this new mode of production. The thesis thereby contributes to research on peer production communities, social shaping of technology and sustainable design. Knowledge of current maker practices and their sustainability implications have value for the peer communities studied, but also potentially technology developers and policy makers. As Fab Labs are experimental spaces for new digital manufacturing capabilities and activities, the wider implications of the findings may indicate how increasing digitalization and citizen involvement in production will transform design and production – and the sustainability implications therein.},

Rapid economic growth has helped China to become one of the most important world economic powers, increasing the wealth of the population and providing employment and business opportunities. The rapid economic growth, however has engendered serious natural resource depletion and environmental pollution, and the continuing increase of population has exacerbated this situation. As the results of resource depletion and environmental negligence have become visible, Chinese society and decision makers have realized the seriousness of the situation. The concept of a circular economy (CE) was first proposed by scholars in China in 1998 and formally accepted in 2002 by the central government as a new development strategy that aims to alleviate the contradiction between rapid economic growth and the shortage of raw materials and energy.},

Findings – Based on academic literature on field trials, user engagement and the technology acceptance model, the authors argue that several factors play a role in the participation of users in field trials. An influential factor that emerged is the functional maturity of the innovation, the extent to which a prototype resembles the functionalities and the processes of the final, go-to-market product at the moment of the field trial. Within this exploratory paper, we propose the “user engagement model for field trials” to explain the factors that play a role in the engagement of end-users in field trials. Research limitations/implications – The methodological limitations of a case study design make it difficult to extrapolate the findings toward a larger sample. Therefore, this paper focuses on making an in-depth analysis rather than making general claims. However, the insights regarding user engagement for participation pave the way for future validation on a larger scale and suggest future research directions. Practical implications – The findings of this paper suggest that Living Lab field trials should carefully take into account the (perceived) functional maturity of the innovation and the specific characteristics of the innovation when engaging end-users for field trials. Interaction and trust between the test-users and the other stakeholders is of great importance for the active engagement of test-users during field trials. Originality/value – This exploratory paper adds to a general understanding of end-user involvement in innovation development processes and suggests guidelines to engage end-users to participate in field trials. In addition, it introduces the concept of functional maturity of innovations and the user-engagement model for field trials.},

This study of 2621 Niagara, Canada, residents sought to understand the attitudinal and sociodemographic drivers of participation and non-participation in OWDP. Additionally, we examined the impact of messaging about the benefits of OWDP on likelihood of future participation while varying the frame and perceived source of information. Participants reported environmental factors as the main motivators for OWDP involvement, while non-participants cited smell, inconvenience and cost as the most salient barriers. Several sociodemographic and knowledge factors predicted participation, as did strong recognition of the anthropogenic origins of climate change. Forty two percent of non-participants were more likely to participate after receiving the educational message, but this did not vary with information source nor a social-norm frame. These findings inform theory around pro-environmental behaviour and provide actionable information for education campaigns aimed at promoting OWDP.},

This paper presents a framework for mapping science and technology-based industrial emergence, in order to better understand the nature and characteristics of such phenomena, as a basis for improved strategy development. A full lifecycle perspective is included, emphasizing early stage phases associated with scientific and technological developments, together with key transitions between phases related to the conversion of scientific knowledge to technological capability, application, industrial activity and economic value. Roadmapping concepts are used to map industrial emergence phenomena from various perspectives that cover value creation and capture activities together with demand and supply-side factors. The framework has been tested by developing more than 25 diverse 'emergence maps' of historical industrial evolution, building confidence that the framework might be applicable to current and future emergence. Common characteristics of industrial emergence have been identified, including key events and milestones, focusing on a chain of demonstrators that delineate the various phases and transitions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Plastic solid waste (PSW) presents challenges and opportunities to societies regardless of their sustainability awareness and technological advances. In this paper, recent progress in the recycling and recovery of PSW is reviewed. A special emphasis is paid on waste generated from polyolefinic sources, which makes up a great percentage of our daily single-life cycle plastic products. The four routes of PSW treatment are detailed and discussed covering primary (re-extrusion), secondary (mechanical), tertiary (chemical) and quaternary (energy recovery) schemes and technologies. Primary recycling, which involves the re-introduction of clean scrap of single polymer to the extrusion cycle in order to produce products of the similar material, is commonly applied in the processing line itself but rarely applied among recyclers, as recycling materials rarely possess the required quality. The various waste products, consisting of either end-of-life or production (scrap) waste, are the feedstock of secondary techniques, thereby generally reduced in size to a more desirable shape and form, such as pellets, flakes or powders, depending on the source, shape and usability. Tertiary treatment schemes have contributed greatly to the recycling status of PSW in recent years. Advanced thermo-chemical treatment methods cover a wide range of technologies and produce either fuels or petrochemical feedstock. Nowadays, non-catalytic thermal cracking (thermolysis) is receiving renewed attention, due to the fact of added value on a crude oil barrel and its very valuable yielded products. But a fact remains that advanced thermo-chemical recycling of PSW (namely polyolefins) still lacks the proper design and kinetic background to target certain desired products and/or chemicals. Energy recovery was found to be an attainable solution to PSW in general and municipal solid waste (MSW) in particular. The amount of energy produced in kilns and reactors applied in this route is sufficiently investigated up to the point of operation, but not in terms of integration with either petrochemical or converting plants. Although primary and secondary recycling schemes are well established and widely applied, it is concluded that many of the PSW tertiary and quaternary treatment schemes appear to be robust and worthy of additional investigation.},

abstract = {Non-renewable resources form one of the boundaries of our current linear-growth model. Moving from product-oriented to product-service systems (PSS)-based business models may contribute to the circularity of resource flows while strengthening the competitive advantage of organizations. Scholars have been studying the win-win potential of circular business models from a strategic business perspective for some time. However, methods for increasing consumer participation in circular economy (CE)-linked PSSs are yet to be studied intensively. This is particularly problematic because consumers play a significant and active role in the success of closing material loops. We sought to contribute to the closure of this research gap with a case study, in which we use a mixed-method approach inspired by the outcome-driven innovation (ODI) approach. ODI aims to detect innovation potential based on the job-to-be-done theory at the fuzzy front end of innovation. This indicates user-centric connection points for new value proposition development for circular business models. In our case study of the consumer electronics industry, we exemplify how insights about consumer needs along the lifecycle of a TV can be derived. We first interviewed a sample of consumers in order to qualitatively analyze and identify the problems they currently face when trying to solve an entertainment interruption. This revealed 30 consumer needs. In a second step, we evaluated these needs in a survey to quantify their potential according to the degree of importance and satisfaction associated with each. Our analysis revealed that 11 of the 30 needs are currently not well satisfied. These needs are linked as innovation opportunities to potential PSSs, providing a foundation for customer-centric value propositions design to foster the implementation of the CE. Our study not only advances the understanding of consumer need-orientation in CE literature, but also yields valuable contributions to the methodological repertoire for customer-centric innovation management in the CE context. Additionally, it outlines directions for further research on refining ODI for the purpose of connecting individual consumer needs with societal needs.},

abstract = {The growing global population and its effects on world food security, as well as the urgency for climate change mitigation, are issues that foster technological, social, and political innovations to increase the efficiency of use of natural resources, such as biomass among others. While significant research efforts have been devoted to biomass conversion processes, their associated supply chains and their implication for complete process efficiency have only been studied more recently. However, most of the recent investigations into the design and optimization of biomass supply chains have focused on an economic point of view, sidelining other dimensions of sustainability, which represents a serious drawback for this kind of work. This article surveys the recent research on design and management optimization of biorefinery supply chains from a sustainability perspective. 72 published research articles from 2006 to 2015 have been analyzed to highlight the sustainability dimensions considered, as well as the inclusion of uncertainties. A typology of decision-making at three levels of analysis (strategic, tactical and operational), and the specific set of tools used to model and optimize the biorefinery supply chain have also been studied. The conclusion underlines the contributions and shortcomings of current research and suggests possible future directions.},

abstract = {Sustainability in additive manufacturing refers mainly to the recycling rate of polymers and composites used in fused filament fabrication (FFF), which nowadays are rapidly increasing in volume and value. Recycling of such materials is mostly a thermomechanical process that modifies their overall mechanical behavior. The present research work focuses on the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymer, which is the second most popular material used in FFF-3D printing. In order to investigate the effect of the recycling courses on the mechanical response of the ABS polymer, an experimental simulation of the recycling process that isolates the thermomechanical treatment from other parameters (i.e., contamination, ageing, etc.) has been performed. To quantify the effect of repeated recycling processes on the mechanic response of the ABS polymer, a wide variety of mechanical tests were conducted on FFF-printed specimens. Regarding this, standard tensile, compression, flexion, impact and micro-hardness tests were performed per recycle repetition. The findings prove that the mechanical response of the recycled ABS polymer is generally improved over the recycling repetitions for a certain number of repetitions. An optimum overall mechanical behavior is found between the third and the fifth repetition, indicating a significant positive impact of the ABS polymer recycling, besides the environmental one.},

Several common potable water pipe and gasket plastics were examined as well as Alconox{\textregistered}detergent, Dawn{\textregistered}soap, and MAGIT-DG 100 surfactants. Results showed that the MAGIT-DG 100 solutions permeated all plastics within 3 days, effectively compromising tensile strength (−82{\%}), physical dimension (+43{\%} volume, +45{\%} weight), and oxidative resistance (−15{\%}). A variety of MAGIT-DG 100 solution compounds permeated plastic samples, not just the declared major ingredient. PVC and cPVC pipes sorbed the least amount of this solution's components of all the plastic pipes tested. Alconox{\textregistered}and Dawn{\textregistered}solutions caused minimal changes to the physical and mechanical properties of all plastics examined. Crosslinked polyethylene type A (PEX-a) pipe was more susceptible to crude oil contamination than copper pipe. Flushing with a pure water Alconox{\textregistered}solution mixture removed all benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and total xylenes (BTEX) from copper pipe. No decontamination method affected BTEX removal from PEX pipe. Under certain conditions surfactant solutions have the potential to alter material integrity and may not be a viable option in removing hydrophobic organic compounds from plastic pipe.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd It is well known that Asia generates and receives large quantities of plastic waste. Through a detailed study of plastic waste generation and trade, the management and treatment of plastic waste in Asia were analyzed from the regional perspective. The amounts of plastic waste in municipal solid waste and in industrial solid waste were estimated to be 79 Mt and 42 Mt, respectively, in Asia. The overall treatment and recycling status in Asia are unsatisfactory. Asia imported 74{\%} of the plastic waste in the world in 2016, and China (mainland) imported the most plastic waste until 2017, with 5.8 to 8.3 Mt. In 2017, about half the plastic waste imported by Asia came from other regions, and after subtracting the exported quantity, 98{\%} of the plastic waste was left in Asia for treatment and disposal. The plastic waste imported by Asia declined about 72{\%} in monetary value in 2018. There is still a large gap between the plastic waste quantity imported to Asia and that exported from Asia. China's ban of plastic waste imports caused import quantities to drop to 52 kt in 2018, simultaneously, exports from the largest exporting countries or regions such as Hong Kong (China), the USA, Japan, and Germany decreased. While Vietnam, Malaysia and some other Asian countries and regions saw significant increases in plastic waste imports from 2016 to 2018. Considering this situation, countries in Asia are starting to strictly limit plastic waste imports from other countries.},

abstract = {In the last few years Circular Economy (CE) is receiving increasing attention worldwide as a way to overcome the current production and consumption model based on continuous growth and increasing resource throughput. By promoting the adoption of closing-the-loop production patterns within an economic system CE aims to increase the efficiency of resource use, with special focus on urban and industrial waste, to achieve a better balance and harmony between economy, environment and society. This study provides an extensive review of the literature of last two decades, with the purpose of grasping the main CE features and perspectives: origins, basic principles, advantages and disadvantages, modelling and implementation of CE at the different levels (micro, meso and macro) worldwide. Results evidence that CE origins are mainly rooted in ecological and environmental economics and industrial ecology. In China CE is promoted as a top-down national political objective while in other areas and countries as European Union, Japan and USA it is a tool to design bottom-up environmental and waste management policies. The ultimate goal of promoting CE is the decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth. The implementation of CE worldwide still seems in the early stages, mainly focused on recycle rather than reuse. Important results have been achieved in some activity sectors (e.g. in waste management, where large waste recycling rates are achieved in selected developed countries). CE implies the adoption of cleaner production patterns at company level, an increase of producers and consumers responsibility and awareness, the use of renewable technologies and materials (wherever possible) as well as the adoption of suitable, clear and stable policies and tools. The lesson learned from successful experiences is that the transition towards CE comes from the involvement of all actors of the society and their capacity to link and create suitable collaboration and exchange patterns. Success stories also point out the need for an economic return on investment, in order to provide suitable motivation to companies and investors. In summary, the CE transition has just started. Moreover, the interdisciplinary framework underpinning CE offers good prospects for gradual improvement of the present production and consumption models, no longer adequate because of their environmental load and social inequity, a clear indicator of resource use inefficiency.},

abstract = {A new technique is introduced which addresses the need for faster additive manufacturing methods for tissue scaffolds and frozen foods in large-scale industrial applications, inspired by print lithography. It is particularly relevant to biological matter, which is composed mostly of water. Instead of point-by-point printing in three dimensions (3D) with 3D printers, multiple single 2D layers can be assembled or printed separately, in parallel, on areas coated with hydrophilic materials to bind water-based compounds and hydrophobic materials to reject water-based compounds and bind hydrophobic molecules. This technique keeps the layers attached to the surface, opposing gravity, and thereby facilitating the transport and the assembly of the 2D layers, regardless of the direction of the surface relative to gravity. The individual layers are deposited one on top of the other and linked by chemical cross-linking and freezing to generate a 3D structure. Examples show how complex and large hydrogel-based structures can be manufactured by multi-layer cryolithography from fusion and freezing of 2D layers. Applications involve tissue engineering and food engineering, with particular emphasis on the ability to assemble a biological object, while every volume is frozen under optimal conditions during the assembly. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrates the ability to control and produce uniform microstructures in the 3D objects produced by cryolithography.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) printing has the potential to transform science and technology by creating bespoke, low-cost appliances that previously required dedicated facilities to make. An attractive, but unexplored, application is to use a 3D printer to initiate chemical reactions by printing the reagents directly into a 3D reactionware matrix, and so put reactionware design, construction and operation under digital control. Here, using a low-cost 3D printer and open-source design software we produced reactionware for organic and inorganic synthesis, which included printed-in catalysts and other architectures with printed-in components for electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis. This enabled reactions to be monitored in situ so that different reactionware architectures could be screened for their efficacy for a given process, with a digital feedback mechanism for device optimization. Furthermore, solely by modifying reactionware architecture, reaction outcomes can be altered. Taken together, this approach constitutes a relatively cheap, automated and reconfigurable chemical discovery platform that makes techniques from chemical engineering accessible to typical synthetic laboratories.},

abstract = {Given the increasing efforts at improving waste management in developing countries, this study aimed to analyze factors that influence participation in household waste sorting. It thereby is the first review that extends the published literature on this topic. A meta-analysis was conducted that analyzed twelve influencing factors. A moderate correlation was found for the most strongly influential factors—attitude, moral norm, subjective norm and perceived behavior control—which indicates that people's perception of waste sorting is most influencing in prompting participation in household waste sorting in developing countries. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that knowledge, situational factors, such as physical conditions, and governmental incentives can influence participation in household waste sorting in developing countries but the relationship between those factors and other factors with high correlations should be studied further. Notably, socio-demographic factors have the weakest influence on the participation in waste sorting in developing countries despite a large body of research on such factors. It can be constructive to take the relationship across the identified factors and the participation in waste sorting into consideration when aiming to implement measures to increase the participation in waste management schemes through waste sorting. The outcome of this study may contribute to recommendations and policy suggestions regarding the promotion of sustainable waste management through household waste sorting in developing countries.},

These include Sarrat, Vintar, and Solsona in the province of Ilocos Norte. An equal number of respondents were surveyed from each municipality. Results suggest that age, municipality, dumping solid waste in public areas compared to dropping it off at designated locations, and composting solid waste compared to dropping it off at designated locations are all predictors of weekly plastic bag consumption. Education variables were not predictors of weekly plastic bag consumption nor were perceptions of plastic bags as bad for the environment. This suggests that additional educational programs and incentives are needed at the local levels to reduce plastic bag consumption.},

abstract = {Literature of cleaner production shows that, for improving the environmental performance of the organization, it is important to provide employees with specific green-related competencies and to buy their commitment towards the green cause. Accordingly, studies explored the effects on environmental performance of green human resource management, in which green training (i.e. interventions aimed at developing green-related competencies) resulted as a key practice. This paper enriches the fast growing literature on green training in two directions. First, showing that green training is associated with employees engagement in voluntary pro-environmental behaviours; our evidence shows this relationship is mediated by the fact that green training enacts a sense of challenge in employees, which motivates them to engage in green-oriented discretionary effort. Second, the paper shows that – diversely from other types of training - green training makes employees more satisfied with their jobs; this relationship emerged as mediated by the employees' perception that green training is as a form of support provided by their employer, which makes their professional experience more satisfying. Those results are achieved through a survey to 260 healthcare professionals. This sector was selected as an extreme case, as current research has demonstrated that it is hard for healthcare professionals – given their organizational autonomy, and professional values - to engage in green-related behaviours, and to see their employer's support on the green cause as a driver for their job satisfaction. Implication for theory and practice are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {The degradation of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) during thermal–mechanical processing was studied and the influence of processing conditions on degradation rate was determined by size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering (SEC–MALS). A two-parameter model accounting for both chain scission and recombination processes was used to describe the experimentally observed molar mass distribution. The degradation and recombination rate constants were determined for undried and dried PLA. It was highlighted that the effect of processing temperature (in the 170–210 °C range), processing time (until 30 min) and shear rate (rotor speed varying from 0 to 150 rpm) on molar mass reduction can be relatively well simulated insofar as self-heating related to the mechanical energy conversion into heat was taken into account. The influence of melt processing on the thermal behaviour of PLA was also investigated using temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC). It was evidenced that the molar mass reduction affects the crystallizability of PLA. Cold crystallization temperature progressively decreases with decreasing molar mass and the metastable $\alpha$' phase is formed in place of the stable $\alpha$ phase. The $\alpha$′ phase can be partially converted into $\alpha$ form during melting giving rise to a double-melting peak. The two peaks can be separated using reversing and non-reversing signals confirming that recrystallization of the $\alpha$′ form occurs.},

abstract = {The development of low-cost desktop versions of three-dimensional (3D) printers has made these devices widely accessible for rapid prototyping and small-scale manufacturing in home and office settings. Many desktop 3D printers rely on heated thermoplastic extrusion and deposition, which is a process that has been shown to have significant aerosol emissions in industrial environments. However, we are not aware of any data on particle emissions from commercially available desktop 3D printers. Therefore, we report on measurements of size-resolved and total ultrafine particle (UFP) concentrations resulting from the operation of two types of commercially available desktop 3D printers inside a commercial office space. We also estimate size-resolved (11.5nm-116nm) and total UFP ({\textless}100nm) emission rates and compare them to emission rates from other desktop devices and indoor activities known to emit fine and ultrafine particles. Estimates of emission rates of total UFPs were large, ranging from {\~{}}2.0×1010{\#}min-1 for a 3D printer utilizing a polylactic acid (PLA) feedstock to {\~{}}1.9×1011{\#}min-1 for the same type of 3D printer utilizing a higher temperature acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) thermoplastic feedstock. Because most of these devices are currently sold as standalone devices without any exhaust ventilation or filtration accessories, results herein suggest caution should be used when operating in inadequately ventilated or unfiltered indoor environments.

abstract = {The growth of desktop 3-D printers is driving an interest in recycled 3-D printer filament to reduce costs of distributed production. Life cycle analysis studies were performed on the recycling of high density polyethylene into filament suitable for additive layer manufacturing with 3-D printers. The conventional centralized recycling system for high population density and low population density rural locations was compared to the proposed in home, distributed recycling system. This system would involve shredding and then producing filament with an open-source plastic extruder from post-consumer plastics and then printing the extruded filament into usable, value-added parts and products with 3-D printers such as the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper, or RepRap. The embodied energy and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated for high density polyethylene recycling using SimaPro 7.2 and the database EcoInvent v2.0. The results showed that distributed recycling uses less embodied energy than the best- case scenario used for centralized recycling. For centralized recycling in a low-density population case study involving substantial embodied energy use for transportation and collection these savings for distributed recycling were found to extend to over 80{\%}. If the distributed process is applied to the U.S. high density polyethylene currently recycled, more than 100 million MJ of energy could be conserved per annum along with the concomitant significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. It is concluded that with the open-source 3-D printing network expanding rapidly the potential for widespread adop- tion of in-home recycling of post-consumer plastic represents a novel path to a future of distributed manufacturing appropriate for both the developed and developing world with lower environmental impacts than the current system},
annote = {Goal
Determine whether the use of RecycleBot to create 3-D printin filament using HDPE is an environmentally feasible alternative to conventionally recycling HDPE.

Conclusion
Distributed recycling of post-consumer HDPE for 3D printing filament uses less embodied energy (Reduction up to 80{\%} in transportation and collection) than the best-case scenario investigated for a high-population density using centralized recycling.},

abstract = {Recycling of plastic is an important step towards circular economy. However, plastic from household waste (HHW) is a heterogeneous and contaminated resource, leading to recycled plastic with reduced quality, limiting the potential for closed-loop recycling. In addition to regulatory requirements for the chemical composition of recycled plastic, reduced physical and mechanical properties may limit the potential for closed-loop recycling. Consequently, this study analyses the thermal degradation, processability and mechanical properties of a range of reprocessed PET, PE and PP samples from source-separated plastic in HHW. On this basis, the potential for closed-loop recycling is evaluated. The study demonstrated that PET, PE and PP recycling represent different challenges. Potential degradation of the PET polymer can be reversed in a decontamination process, making PET waste well-suited for closed-loop, multiple times recycling, even when the degree of heterogeneity in the waste is high. The processability of different kinds of PE and PP packaging types varied considerably, especially for PP. Consequently, current recycling of mixed PP waste and even separate recycling of individual PP waste packaging types, will not technically facilitate recycling into new packaging products. This highlights the importance of PE and PP waste homogeneity when sent to reprocessing. Such homogeneity may be achieved through additional plastic sorting and regulatory harmonisation of product design, accounting for polymer properties and recyclability. Degradation of PP during recycling was shown to be substantial, representing another important limitation for PP recycling, necessary to address in the future.},

PET chemical recycling was divided into the following categories of reactions: hydrolysis, glycolysis, alcoholysis and aminolysis, and each of these groups has been characterized. On the basis of the available literature, the methods used to carry out the reaction, the conditions of their conduct and the synthesis products obtained were presented.

abstract = {To overcome the challenge of upcycling plastic waste into 3-D printing filament in the distributed recycling and additive manufacturing systems, this study designs, builds, tests and validates an open source 3-D filament diameter sensor for recycling and winding machines. The modular system for multi-axis optical control of the diameter of the recycled 3-D-printer filament makes it possible to analyze the surface structure of the processed filament, save the history of measurements along the entire length of the spool, as well as mark defective areas. The sensor is developed as an independent module and integrated into a recyclebot. The diameter sensor was tested on different kinds of polymers (ABS, PLA) different sources of plastic (recycled 3-D prints and virgin plastic waste) and different colors including clear plastic. The results of the diameter measurements using the camera were compared with the manual measurements, and the measurements obtained with a one-dimensional digital light caliper. The results found that the developed open source filament sensing method allows users to obtain significantly more information in comparison with basic one-dimensional light sensors and using the received data not only for more accurate diameter measurements, but also for a detailed analysis of the recycled filament surface. The developed method ensures greater availability of plastics recycling technologies for the manufacturing community and stimulates the growth of composite materials creation. The presented system can greatly enhance the user possibilities and serve as a starting point for a complete recycling control system that will regulate motor parameters to achieve the desired filament diameter with acceptable deviations and even control the extrusion rate on a printer to recover from filament irregularities.},

abstract = {In the last years, the circular economy (CE) paradigm is being widely explored by researchers and institutions as a possible path to increase the sustainability of our economic system. Reuse, repair and recycling are becoming crucial activities in many sectors. At the same time, companies are showing an increasing interest for this new economic model. However, the state of the art shows that a deep research on CE assessment and indicators is still lacking, in particular on the micro level. This work tries to fill this gap, first analyzing the current literature on CE assessment, then proposing a reference framework for the monitoring phase of a CE strategy. Finally, the main existing environmental assessment methodologies based on indexes are analyzed according to their suitability to evaluate the circularity of a system. A systematic approach for the choice of the adequate methodology is also provided, highlighting the main critical steps in the assessment of a CE strategy. Further research could be focused either on the extension of this approach to include other assessment methods, and on the validation of this proposal in a case study.},

abstract = {Test artifacts have been used to evaluate additive manufacturing (AM) systems since the early 1990s with over 65 artifacts published to date. Due to the system agnostic approach to artifact design, principally focused on geometric accuracy, there has yet to be a widely adopted artifact for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). To speed qualification of LPBF, a rapid method that quantifies impacts of process variables on part structure, properties, and performance is required. Using a list of design requirements developed from literature, build experience, and needs from several major roadmapping efforts, a test artifact was designed to evaluate geometry-specific microstructure, dimensional accuracy, residual stress, chemistry, surface integrity, powder removal, and distortion. The LPBF artifact includes: four sides for geometric feature accuracy and surface integrity analysis, indication marks for accurate sectioning for metallography, and additional features specifically designed to evaluate residual stress, powder removal, mechanical properties and distortion. The artifact is compact and designed to fit within a standard 50 mm metallographic mount with indication marks used to improve measurement repeatability and accuracy. Microstructure and anomaly population are quantifiable on features including overhangs, islands, thin features, channels, lattice structures and bulk areas representing different thermal histories. It is believed that this single test artifact can be used for many purposes, including optimization of LPBF input variables, qualification and more. Ongoing work is continuing to improve the artifact design, testing its implementation across LPBF platforms, and using the artifact to concretely define process sensitivity currently limiting standardization and adoption of LPBF due to costs associated with defining process windows in terms of qualification and certification. As part of this effort, the artifact described here forms the basis of the Global Test Artifact Data Exchange Program – a program designed and managed by the authors for the benefit of research to advance LPBF qualification efforts and help lead to more widespread adoption of LPBF (described in more detail at keck.utep.edu/GTADExP).},

Understanding of change needs, does not seem to convert into sufficient change action. Sustainability issues are often complex, interdependent and hard to comprehend, indicating that sustainable development, in addition to change willingness, requires a holistic perspective. Seeing and understanding systems - systems thinking - is important. This implies that sense-making of systems and of sustainable development is important as a prerequisite for change. Possibilities of realising synergies between quality management and sustainable development are often discussed but do often not seem to be fully realised. This paper tests two system models from Quality Management in the context of sustainability in cement manufacturing and building material production. The indicative results suggest that the proposed system models are able to describe and identify improvement opportunities that could be used to create interest for change.},

abstract = {Science as a social institution has evolved as the most powerful, highly influential, and sought out institution after the conflicts between science and religion following Galileo. Knowledge as a public good, scientific peer review of science, the prominence of open publications, and the emphasis on professional recognition and scientific autonomy have been the hallmark of science in the past three centuries. According to this scientific spirit, the scientific social system and society formed a unique social contract. This social contract drew considerable institutional and state legitimacy for the openness and public good of science in the service of state and society, all through the post-war period. Openness and public good of science are recognized and legitimized by the scientific community and science agencies at the global level. This paradigm of open science, in varying forms and manifestations, contributed to the progress of systematic knowledge at the service of humankind over the last three centuries. Entering the third decade of the 21st century, the social contract between science and society is undergoing major changes. In fact, the whole paradigm of open science and its social contract is being challenged by various “enemies” or adversaries such as (a) market-based privatized commercial science, (b) industry 4.0 advanced technologies, and (c) a “new iron curtain” on the free flow of science data and information. What is at stake? Are there major changes? Is the very social institution of science transforming? What impact will this have on our contemporary and future sustainable society? These are some important issues that will be addressed in this article.},

abstract = {The management model for the National Solid Waste Policy to develop sustainable actions, proposes the social inclusion of recyclable waste pickers in the waste management system. Compliance with the law, the form of participation of the waste pickers, and incentive mechanisms are configured as a relationship open to analysis. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the potentials and limitations of a recycling cooperative, in terms of social technologies and inclusion, to encourage local development. The qualitative approach was aided by structured questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and participant observation. The resulting evidence suggests that the organization of a cooperative, enabled access to information on the legislation of the National Solid Waste Policy. It showed the need to strengthen relationships with education institutions and public authorities. Despite the low levels of education of the members of the cooperative, projects and knowledge could be developed to aid social technologies. No technological innovations were observed, nor the production of alternative artifacts for recyclable materials. This weakens the cooperative in terms of articulation among peers, most notably the integration of the Catamare cooperative in the network of Cataparan{\'{a}}, to support the sale of material produced for industry. It may be concluded that joining the cooperative improved the social, economic, and political conditions of the members, but there were also structural limits to the recycling production chain that were not considered in the National Solid Waste Policy; and to a certain extent this weakens the development of sustainable actions. Furthermore, the organization of the cooperative hindered the development of social technologies and the social inclusion of the waste pickers.},

abstract = {With the 26{\%} annual growth rate of additive manufacturing, especially in the area of 3D polymer printing, the amount of waste is increasing at a rapid rate. Limited research in the area of recycling has been produced, yet there are several recycling machines being developed for home use. Despite this work there is no published mechanical data on components produced with filament recycled from 3D printed parts. There is very limited data on mechanical properties of any 3D printed materials. This article compares the properties of parts 3D printed with virgin polylactic acid (PLA) to those printed with recycled PLA. Using commercially available PLA and an entry level 3D printer, tensile and shear specimens were produced and then tested for tensile yield strength, modulus of elasticity, shear yield strength, and hardness. The specimens were then ground up and re-extruded into filament, and a second set of specimens were produced and tested using this recycled PLA filament. Mechanical testing showed that 3D printing with recycled PLA is a viable option. With the recycled filament, tensile strength decreased 10.9{\%}, shear strength increased 6.8{\%}, and hardness decreased 2.4{\%}. The tensile modulus of elasticity was statistically unchanged. Although the average mechanical properties before and after recycling were similar, there was more variability in the results of the recycled filament. Additionally, when printing with the recycled filament there was some nozzle clogging, while none occurred with the virgin filament. Overall, the mechanical properties of specimens 3D printed from recycled PLA filament were similar to virgin properties, encouraging further development in the area of recycling 3D printed filament.},

abstract = {The EC circular economy waste directive sets ambitious recycling and reuse targets towards waste reduction and banning of landfills. Monitoring of wastes can lead to efficient policies and implementation of proactive measures for waste reduction. Up-to-date methods for waste monitoring in cyclic economy (CE)may not provide reliable and useful figures. Product stock-in-use and flows in CE, including waste flows, are uncertain due to varying demand and imports/exports, random, early losses of stock-in-use, delayed and distributed product returns or end-of-life exit and varying utilization of returns by remanufacturers. Adopting a systems perspective and using a dynamic/stochastic model of stock and flows in CE, this work quantifies waste monitoring and reduction under realistic conditions. It reveals how consumption and stock depletion consist the driving forces of waste generation, compensated by cyclic actions, reuse/remanufacturing and recycle. The conventional recycling rate and other key parameters, including the reuse rate, the mean lifetime, the remanufacturing rate, the number of reuse cycles, are shown inapt to accurately monitor end-wastes. None can consistently distinguish the environmentally superior system or state, featuring lower end-wastes. Higher recycling rates and/or higher reuse rates may not ensure lower wastes. Asymmetric policies (differing recycle and reuse rates)can be advantageous: higher reuse is preferable under rising stock and higher recycle under stock depletion. Sharp real-time monitoring of end-wastes is provided by the cycle rate, a dimensionless rate accounting for consumption and stock variations in CE. Its supreme efficacy is demonstrated in a robust Case study (US cellular phones)via Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo simulation.},

abstract = {Polymeric foams can be found virtually everywhere due to their advantageous properties compared with counterparts materials. Possibly the most important class of polymeric foams are polyurethane foams (PUFs), as their low density and thermal conductivity combined with their interesting mechanical properties make them excellent thermal and sound insulators, as well as structural and comfort materials. Despite the broad range of applications, the production of PUFs is still highly petroleum-dependent, so this industry must adapt to ever more strict regulations and rigorous consumers. In that sense, the well-established raw materials and process technologies can face a turning point in the near future, due to the need of using renewable raw materials and new process technologies, such as three-dimensional (3D) printing. In this work, the fundamental aspects of the production of PUFs are reviewed, the new challenges that the PUFs industry are expected to confront regarding process methodologies in the near future are outlined, and some alternatives are also presented. Then, the strategies for the improvement of PUFs sustainability, including recycling, and the enhancement of their properties are discussed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 {\AA}rdal and R{\o}ttingen. Background: Nodding syndrome is a neurological disease with no known cure or treatment, impacting children aged 3-18 years old, mainly in East Africa. Children progressively develop varying degrees of cognitive impairment which may lead to severe wasting, a vegetative state and, eventually, death. Despite its 50-year existence, little is known about its cause, risk factors and prognosis. It is a disease where markets will not provide solutions because the patients are both too few and too poor, making it especially neglected. Open source innovation has been recommended as an approach to neglected disease research in order to maximize available funding through greater collaboration and openness to results. Nodding syndrome is a useful case to examine the relevance of open source innovation. Methods: We assessed the magnitude of research related to nodding syndrome, its availability, financing and the amount of collaboration. We surveyed researchers regarding their motivations, attitudes toward open source innovation concepts and barriers to greater collaboration. Results: Little research is occurring for nodding syndrome, but it is openly available and researchers are highly collaborative. The disease is largely unknown, which is partly attributed to WHO not classifying nodding syndrome as a neglected tropical disease and not including it in any formal programme. Impacted countries, particularly Uganda, demonstrate a strong degree of ownership through both authorship and research financing. Nodding syndrome researchers have been allocated a total of €5 million from 2013 to 2019 in grant funding. Annual financing, due to three new grants, doubled from 2014 to 2015. Conclusions: Nodding syndrome, a disease previously ignored by the international community, is starting to receive greater attention, although financing remains modest. If infectious, a larger epidemic could take the world by surprise. Open source innovation can likely help by sharing research protocols (to avoid duplication) and early research results (to adjust to the findings of others). The existing scientists have already endorsed open source innovation, but increased financing is needed. The support of just a few high-income countries could reap a large impact.},

abstract = {The overall objective of this work was to study the effect of reprocessing cycles of isotactic polypropylene (PP) on the rheological behavior and microstructure of gel-like dispersions in mineral oil. PP was subjected to 10 reprocessing cycles and oleogel samples were further prepared by using the mixing rheometry technique and characterized from a rheological point of view and polarized light optical microscopy (PLOM). Recycled polymer samples were also characterized by means of rheological measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to evaluate the property changes induced by reprocessing. The values of different linear viscoelastic functions (elastic modulus and complex viscosity) of recycled PP decrease with the number of reprocessing cycles, which influences oleogel rheological response. An empirical exponential correlation between the storage modulus (G′) of PP samples and the plateau modulus (GNo) of oleogels has been proposed to predict the rheological behavior of oleogels. Results were explained considering the scission of PP chains induced by the thermomechanical reprocessing treatment applied.},

abstract = {The European Union has recently introduced the 'circular economy' as a high-level strategy to move our societies beyond the limits to growth. In the eyes of European policy makers, we will reach a circular economy through business innovation or the promotion of existing sustainable business models based on circular economy principles. Yet, we know next to nothing about how European businesses perceive or take up this strategy and whether it contributes to business innovation or the promotion of sustainable business models. To fill this gap, this paper analyses the business community's view on the circular economy. It focuses on the bio-based sector as one of the most resource-intensive in Europe and scrutinizes EU level debates as well as business practices in Germany. Based on a document analysis and participant observation data, the results show that business stakeholders currently relate the circular economy predominantly to established practices and to technological business models. This leaves considerable room for innovation in areas like social or organizational business models. Yet, the directions and effects of current activities remain uncertain. Connecting the debates about the circular economy and the bioeconomy could benefit the discussion of these possible directions and their effects. As our results show, exploring the relation between the circular economy and the bioeconomy highlights the need to define which cycles contribute most to a sustainable future economy. Existing guidelines and standards developed for businesses have been criticized for lacking exactly this definition. Hence, strengthening the link between circular economy and bioeconomy debates may provide a crucial step towards defining the sustainability of the circular economy, thereby setting clear priorities for sustainable business practices.},

abstract = {To address the problems associated with laminated object manufacturing (LOM) using sheet metal as a modeling material, an approach of cutting the sheet metals by a new LOM process and connecting them by diffusion welding technology is proposed. The conventional LOM process and the new LOM process are compared with reference to the theoretical manufacturing error. A slicing algorithm for the new LOM process has been deduced. The conclusions drawn from the experiments and analysis are shrinkage in the stack direction is small; atom diffusion between two joints occurs clearly and new grains form; the shear strength of the welding zone is above 100 MPa; the micro-hardness of the welding zone is almost the same as that of the substrate. The fabrication of sample part suggests that the new LOM process with diffusion welding could be a useful method for the rapid manufacturing of metal parts. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Recycling is crucial for the conservation and improvement of the environment. The reduction of natural resource exploration and recovery of waste are examples of actions to contribute to a sustainable development. Waste from end-of-life tires and undifferentiated plastics represents an environmental problem due to the very high number of tons of used tires and plastics produced, but with a high economic potential because their incorporation into high value-added products is an issue of utmost importance. The manufacturing technologies oriented to the increase in quality levels, functional advantages, structural and financial gains of the produced products are currently a hot topic in industry. Similarly, the use of additive manufacturing technologies, instead of conventional techniques, e.g. moulding to process materials obtained from waste recovery, is a great industrial challenge. In order to promote greater environmental responsibility and to present innovative solutions for the management and sustainable destination of used waste recovery from tires and undifferentiated plastics, a composite made from the blend of 60{\%} of tire waste granulate and 40{\%} of polypropylene (PP) recycled was tested with the final purpose of generating components with added value. Both waste recovery materials were used in the micronized state. The thermal and mechanical behaviours of the synthesized composite were studied through DSC/TGA analysis and tensile testing. The implementation of additive manufacturing methodologies to process the blends between used tires granulated with a high incorporation of wastes from undifferentiated plastics was also explored in this work in order to produce big green parts without mould needed, such as urban furniture.},

abstract = {Circular economy (CE) promotes better resource use by reducing waste and keeping products and materials in use and supports natural system regeneration. However, the social dimension of CE is virtually non-existent. Moreover, there is no holistic framework to select the social indicators to be used to assess the positive or negative impacts of CE strategies. Thus, this paper proposes an approach to identify key social indicators of CE through qualitative (Delphi) and quantitative (fuzzy logic) tools that objectively account for the uncertainty associated with data collection and judgement elicitation and number of attributes (indicators) by considering the vagueness of the data. The research includes a hybrid approach to explore multiple social indicators, a survey of social indicators for CE experts to arrive at a consensus regarding the social measures that are required and an analysis of the resulting survey data to converge on the key social indicators relevant to CE.. The results show that the most relevant social indicators for CE experts are consumer health and safety, followed by poverty, food security and governance. These findings suggest that indicators such as the eradication of poverty and hunger are priorities for CE experts. This could be attributed to the power of CE practices to help achieve several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets, particularly those that are most directly related to CE strategies.},

The transformation process faces a number of complexities deriving from both institutional and contextual factors. It may generate threats and as well as opportunities to enhance the education system and prepare for potential future emergencies. In this article, we adopted a combined research approach to describe the experience of the Contamination Lab of the University of Salento (CLab@Salento), an entrepreneurship education program focused on innovative and technology-based entrepreneurship for university students. Moving from the analysis of the main challenges the pandemic generated for the institution, students and faculty, we illustrate the process of redesigning the entrepreneurial learning program by leveraging digital technologies. We show a new approach to entrepreneurial storytelling, pitching and business planning and development through digital technologies. We also report the outcomes of a student survey to highlight the strengths of the redesigned program and some weaknesses, especially associated with digital technologies' limitations in education, which represent areas for future improvement. The study contributes at theory level with a new discussion on digital-supported entrepreneurship education. At practitioner level, it offers insights on redesigning traditional university programs to effectively address emergencies.},

abstract = {In the future, long-established paradigms of production will still have to continue to change in order to meet the demand for even more individuality, customer-specific product variants and shortest delivery times within the meaning of the term “production on demand”. Therefore, in the future, the concept of the Distributed Manufacturing by geographically distributed production systems plays an increasingly important role. New and innovative ways of organizing production operations will be needed. Particularly due to the increasingly loud request for a sustainable and ecologically production and distribution decentralized manufacturing systems are an ideal approach, because the production takes place closer to the customer. It needs modern organizational models for small, flexible and scalable production units in decentralized production networks, which take into account the local and individual customer needs and produce as possible locally. This paper presents the drivers for the trend towards decentralized and distributed manufacturing systems. In addition, the paper gives a complete overview of traditional and modern forms of geographically distributed production and the prospect of new and partly visionary development directions. The paper examines the range of the concept of Distributed Manufacturing starting from standardized factories to visionary generative manufacturing units according the concept of Cloud-Production.},

The main problem is the presence of residual contaminants in recycled plastic, because it could pose a risk to public health when in contact with food. Our purpose is to evaluate different types of mechanical recycling in order to decontaminate the polypropylene. Firstly, pellets of polypropylene were contaminated, following the protocol recommended by the FDA. The pellets were subsequently recovered (washed and dried) and the samples were submitted to different extrusion processes. In order to evaluate the decontamination degree of the samples that went through each type of mechanical recycling, extractability tests were performed under different conditions of time, temperature and using different food simulants. The surrogates that migrated (suffered forced migration) were quantified using chromatographic techniques. The results showed that the decontamination degree of the samples changed with the different methods of extrusion applied. They also showed that conditions of time, temperature and different food simulants actually influenced the extraction of the surrogates. {\textcopyright} 2014 Smithers Information Ltd.},

abstract = {Circular economy (CE) is gaining popularity at different levels with the promise of creating more sustainable processes. In this context, cities are implementing a number of initiatives that aim to turn them into sustainable circular systems. Whether these initiatives achieve their sustainability goals, however, is largely unknown. Nevertheless, as the application of CE strategies is actively encouraged by many policies across the globe, there is a need to quantify the environmental impacts and to identify the strategies that support urban sustainability. This paper analyses the extent to which research focuses on quantifying the environmental balance of CE initiatives promoted at the municipal level. To this end, the analysis scanned CE initiatives reported in cities around the globe and classified them into urban targets and CE strategies. In parallel, the paper conducted a review of the literature that uses industrial ecology tools to account for the environmental impacts of CE strategies. Results show a diverse geographical representation, as reported cities concentrated in Europe, whereas for environmental research, the main results came from China. In general, cities encourage strategies relating to urban infrastructure (47{\%}), with and additional focus on social consumption aspects, such as repair and reuse actions. In comparison, research mainly addressed industrial and business practices (58{\%}), but the approach to infrastructure was similar to that of cities, both with a special interest in waste management. Research has yet to assess social consumption and urban planning strategies, the latter essential for defining the impacts of other urban elements. Hence, there is a need to define the environmental impacts of the strategies that cities select in their quest for circularity. Research and practice can also benefit from working collaboratively so as to prioritize the CE strategies that best fit into the features of each urban area.},

While the literature on the CE is expanding, discussion of its implementation in organizations is, so far, rare, along with exploration of the necessary alignment of the CE with green human resource management (GHRM). In this article, we extend the state-of-the-art literature on CE business models through the inclusion of the ‘human side' of such issues. This goal is met by offering an original integrative GHRM framework for organizations developing CE. The theoretical lenses of stakeholders' theory and the resource based view (RBV) form the foundation of this framework, which represents a ‘middle range theory'. We underline the practices and dimensions of the links between GHRM and the ‘ReSOLVE' CE model. Through an exploration of this integrative framework, we propose a future research agenda along with original research propositions. Furthermore, the middle-range integrated theoretical framework we propose can serve both academics and practitioners in developing understanding of the human resource management (HRM) and change management aspects of the CE.},

abstract = {Keeping rheological, mechanical and thermal properties of virgin poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET, is necessary to assure the quality of second-market applications. A comparative study of these properties has been undertaken in virgin, mechanical recycled and commercial recycled PET samples. Viscoelastic characterization was carried out by rheological measurements. Mechanical properties were estimated by tensile and Charpy impact strength tests. Thermal properties and crystallinity were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry and a deconvolution procedure was applied to study the population of the different crystals. Molecular conformational changes related to crystallinity values were studied by FTIR spectroscopy. Variations in average molecular weight were predicted from rheology. Besides, the presence-absence of linear and cyclic oligomeric species was measured by mass spectrometry techniques, as MALDI-TOF. Mechanical recycled PET undergoes a significant decline in rheological, mechanical and thermal properties upon increasing the number of reprocessing steps. This is due to the cleavage of the ester bonds with reduction in molar mass and raise in cyclic oligomeric species, in particular [GTc]n and [GTc]n-G type. Chain shortening plus enrichment in trans conformers favour the crystallization process which occurs earlier and faster with modification in crystal populations. Additional physicochemical steps are necessary to preserve the main benefits of PET. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

By continuous sharing of information among the different product lifecycle phases, product lifecycle management acts as an information strategy, which builds a coherent data structure by consolidating systems. Moreover, when the manufacturing is happening, there is location base information available within manufacturing process, which can be used into tools to assess manufacturing process in context of sustainability. This paper presents a new information strategy framework for the green manufacturing paradigm based on integration between current PLM structure and geographical information systems. The proposed IT framework is a comprehensive qualitative answer to the question of how to design and/or improve green manufacturing systems as well as a roadmap for future quantitative research to better evaluate this new paradigm. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {The 21st century global competition has emphasized design of innovative products and solutions as the core competency requested today in the job market for engineers. To produce good design thinkers, design activities must be implemented in engineering curriculums, and have to start at early years. In this prospect, many leading universities have launched many interesting initiatives. These initiatives are, however, arduous for implementation in the context of universities in the developing countries due to deep-rooted local constraints, like shortage of financial and skilled human resources. Therefore, some tailored design learning initiatives, taking into account these constraints, have to be developed. In this context, a cost-effective project has been designed and implemented, in our faculty, to early introduce mechanical engineering students, in their first years, to engineering design. The proposed project was designed with respect to a proposed framework of desired engineering design competencies in conjunction with concerns for overcoming constraints and barriers of implementation context. The project encompasses two successive activities for the first and second years. The first activity plunges the students in a design thinking approach to create robotic applications using only cost-effective robotic kits. The second activity is dedicated to the design, analysis, and building of mechanical systems using only commonly used materials and cheap open hardware devices. Through this project, the students significantly improved some targeted skills as creative problem solving, communication, and teamwork. Finally, the project is thought to be valuable for all universities with similar context of limited resources.},

abstract = {The objective of this work is to investigate the potential of close-looped recycling of polylactic acid (PLA) that used in 3D printing, from the perspectives of material properties and environmental performance. A commercial grade of PLA was extruded into filament, then was subjected to fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing process. The printed products were later shredded and re-extruded for repeating 3D printing cycle. Samples were taken from each repeating cycle, were characterised in terms of mechanical, rheological, molecular, thermal and morphological properties. In the experiment, the material can only be reprocessed for two 3D printing cycles, as the reprocessed material can no longer be further processing. Although little changes are observed in the mechanical properties, the viscosity measurements suggest that PLA deteriorates significantly due to the repeated FDM 3D printing cycles. The reduced viscosity values are compatible with the decrements in average molecular weights and thermal stability, the increments of carbonyl bonds, crystallinity and pinholes in the materials' surfaces. Virgin PLA was blended into the recycled material to improve the viscosities, which enables the blends 3D printable. The results of life cycle assessment approach show that the environmental burdens associated with close-looped recycling are lower than those of placing the 3D printed products in incineration or in landfill. Incineration might be another environmental alternative, due to the material embodies a relatively high calorific value; however, the material is not recuperated, thus incineration cannot satisfy the more stringent environmental legislations, in which recovery and reuse of materials are rigorously required.},

abstract = {Fused deposition modeling has become one of the most diffused rapid prototyping techniques, which is widely used to fabricate prototypes. However, further application of this technology is severely affected by poor surface roughness primarily due to staircase effect. It is necessary to adopt post-treatment operations to improve surface quality. Chemical finishing is typically employed to finish parts in fused deposition modeling. The purpose of this paper is to provide a universal finishing method or solution for FDM parts made up of PLA, and to represent the evolution of surface topography between adjacent layers during the chemical finishing operation by building a geometrical model of the deposited filament. Case study was used to validate the proposed model by an experimental observation using a 3D laser scanning microscope. The comparison between theoretical computed values and observed data shows a significant reliability by means of statistical analysis. Subsequently a number of specimens are tested to determine the changes in tensile properties of fused deposition modeling parts building in different orientations. The results show that the horizontal build directions have little influence on the tensile strength. And, untreated specimens of polylactic acid show brittle behavior due to the inherent material properties. Because of the thin transparent film formed on the appearance, the tensile mechanical properties of specimens after chemical finishing are obviously changed, with the result that the tensile strength reduces by 63{\%} and elongations at break improve by 50{\%}. This chemical finishing not only decreases the roughness of parts manufactured in fused deposition modeling significantly, but also improves the toughness of polylactic acid parts.},

abstract = {Resource multiple-life-cycle (MLC) recycling process is a complex system with closed-loop and open-loop recycling interwoven with each other, which has recieved vast attention in recent years. Resource MLC recycling has a cascading effect, one recycling process will have an impact on the next cycle, and ultimately affect the overall environmental performance of the social system. Policies will affect the flow of resource MLC recycling. How to maximize the emission reduction effect of resource MLC recycling through policy design is still under exploration. Employing MLC recycling of China's waste PET bottles as an example, this paper constructs an environmental performance accounting method based on MLCA, and simulates the overall impact of various policies such as implementing deposit system, promoting recycled materials, strenghtening environmental regulation and enhancing regeneration technology on the recycling system of PET bottles. The combined policy scenario is constructed by selecting advantageous strategies that can effectively give full play to the strengths of each policy scenario. From 2020 to 2040, the environmental performance loss value of the combined policy scenario will be 52.52{\%} of the baseline scenario without policy support, and the cumulative emission reductions of wastewater, waste gas and solid waste will be 0.98, 3.61 and 341.39 million tonnes respectively, which can help China to achieve emission reduction targets set out in each five-year plan. In order to realize the combined policy scenario, it is suggested that the life cycle assessment (LCA) should be replaced by multiple life cycle assessment (MLCA), the effect of resource saving and environmental emission reduction in the recycling process should be accounted as accurately as possible, a top-level management organization of natural resources across multiple departments should be established as soon as possible, with the goal of maximizing the comprehensive environmental and economic benefits of MLC processes.},

abstract = {Even though much attention has been given to barriers related to implementing circular business models, so far, no studies have focused on how the barriers differ between business models. Ignoring the possibility of such differences could lead to unjustified generalizations about the barriers to implementing circular business models (CBMs). We identified barriers to implementation and compared them for different CBMs by analyzing 43 case studies of CBMs, based on in-depth interviews with 31 Dutch firms. Barriers were analyzed for the following CBMs: circular supplies, resource recovery, product life extension, and the product-as-a-service model. The barriers identified were classified into two broad categories: internal problems related to the firm itself and external barriers related to the firm's environment. This study shows that key challenges were related to the firm's external environment, and that the barriers differed between the four business models studied. Whereas most internal barriers encountered by the product-as-a-service model were to do with organization (for instance, of lease models), the other models reported these barriers less frequently. External supply chain issues were challenging in the resource recovery, product life extension, and circular supplies models, mainly because of great dependence on third parties for the input of discarded products and waste materials.

From our findings we conclude that to stimulate the development of circular businesses, firms and policy makers should focus on bespoke solutions and strategies for different types of CBMs.},

New tools and processes are becoming more accessible to the masses and are being shared all over the world through Internet platforms, with an open source philosophy, both in software and hardware. The collective mind that is being empowered everyday will define the future of production in the life of mankind and its relation with the environment. The role of architects, engineers, designers and many other professionals, will be reshaped and reconfigured to fit into new models of production and creation.

abstract = {Urban Living Labs are development environments that integrate residents and other stakeholders to develop and test new solutions in their daily life. The users of the new services or solutions are active partners in the whole development process, which happens in the real urban context. Urban Living Labs utilize various co-design methods for understanding the needs, generating solution ideas, presenting ideas and evaluating the solutions in practice. In addition, citizen participation methods are used for participation in decision making and taking action. This document presents the boundary conditions for successful Urban Living Lab implementation as well as methods that can be used in different stages of the development process. The report is targeted for municipalities, housing companies and researchers that aim at involving different stakeholders in different kinds of development projects in the urban context. Before starting Urban Living Lab activities, several things have to be checked and planned. First of all, understanding the context is important. This understanding can be obtained by interviewing people from different backgrounds, observing the environment and familiarising oneself with earlier reports written about the area and its challenges. The next tasks is to define the goals for the development project based on the needs of different target groups, identify the residents and other stakeholders who should participate in the project and involve them in defining the aims, clarify the roles in the Urban Living Lab and define a transparent decision making process. Finally, the methods for the specific actions and the communication process should be planned. Key success factors for Urban Living Labs are the early and continuous involvement of the affected people, clear goals and expectations, and acting instead of discussing. The methods must be adapted to the goals and participants. At its best, people can participate in the Urban Living Lab activities as a part of their other activities and see the effects of their participation shortly afterwards.},

abstract = {This paper presents global research trends involving highly cited articles on ecosystem services from 1981 to 2017 based on a bibliometric analysis of such articles from the SCI-E and SSCI databases of the Web of Science. The analysis revealed that there were 132 highly cited articles, most of which were published between 2005 and 2014. Based on author keywords, the term ecosystem services was strongly linked to biodiversity. The top three journals in terms of total number of highly cited articles published were Ecological Economics, PNAS, and Ecological Indicators. Despite ranking sixth overall, Science ranked first in both impact factor and total citations per article. The US, UK, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden were the top five most productive and cooperative countries in the world based on total number of highly cited articles and co-authorship network, respectively. The US was highly connected to Canada, the Netherlands, China and the UK. Stockholm University and Stanford University were the most productive institutions in Europe and North America, respectively. Stanford University is associated with many scholars in the field of ecosystem services research because of the InVEST model. Robert Costanza was the most prolific and highly cited author, the latter being largely due to the first valuation of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital, he and his co-authors published in 1997 in Nature. Terrestrial, urban, and forest ecosystems were the top types of ecosystems assessed. Regulating and provisioning services were the major ecosystem services studied. Quantitative and qualitative assessments were the main research focus. Most of these highly cited studies on ecosystem services are done on areas geographically located in North America and Europe.},

Yet, current supply chains limit access and impede creativity and customization through high mark-ups and proprietary designs, compounded by proprietary hardware licenses and patents. Open Science Hardware (OSH) addresses part of this problem by sharing designs, instructions for building, and protocols. Expanding the reach of OSH within academic research, NGO initiatives, citizen science, and education has potential to increase access to experimental tools and facilitate their customization and reuse. We organized with others the “Gathering for Open Science Hardware” (GOSH) in 2016 to address what we see as the primary barrier to OSH: early adopters are disparate and separated by geographical and disciplinary borders which limit interaction, exchange and community building. This inaugural gathering brought together 50 of the most active developers, users, and thinkers in the OSH movement, complemented by expertise from diverse backgrounds, to seed a global community.

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), colloquially known as 3D printing, is currently being promoted as the spark of a new industrial revolution. The technology allows one to make customized products without incurring any cost penalties in manufacturing as neither tools nor molds are required. Moreover, AM enables the production of complex and integrated functional designs in a one-step process, thereby also potentially reducing the need for assembly work. In this article, we discuss the impact of AM technology at both firm and industry level. Our intention is to discern how market structures will be affected from an operations management perspective. Based on an analysis of established economic models, we first identify the economic and technological characteristics of AM and distill four key principles relevant to manufacturers at firm level. We then critically assess the effects of AM at industry level by analyzing the validity of earlier assumptions in the models when these four principles apply. In so doing, we derive a set of seven propositions which provide impetus for future research. In particular, we propose that in a monopoly, the adoption of AM allows a firm to increase profits by capturing consumer surplus when flexibly producing customized products. Meanwhile in competitive markets, competition is spurred as AM may lower barriers to market entry and offers the ability to serve multiple markets at once. This should ultimately result in lower prices for consumers.},

Recent legislation has made the collection of some discarded plastic articles more efficient, and has provided economic incentives to recover and reuse waste plastics. A discussion of the methods of collecting, separating, cleaning, and fabrication of plastic wastes into useful items leads to the conclusion that much work is yet to be done to develop more efficient ways to perform these tasks. In addition, improvements in blending the disparate plastic materials in wastes could lead to the production of better products made from recycled materials. The public must be made aware of the fact that consumer products made of recycled plastics are often as good as those made of virgin material. And that the resulting environmental benefits as well as energy savings are for the common good. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {The role of universities in climate change education (CCE) is of great importance if the scientific, social, environmental and political challenges the world faces are to be met. Future leaders must make decisions from an informed position and the public will need to embed climate change mitigation tools into their work and private life. It is therefore essential to understand the range of CCE strategies being taken globally by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and to explore and analyse the ways that HEIs could better address this challenge. Consistent with this research need, this paper offers an analysis of the extent to which HEIs in 45 countries approach CCE and provides a conceptual framework for exploring how HEIs are embedding CCE into their curricula. In addition to the specialist approach (where students choose to study a degree to become experts in climate change adaptation and mitigation tools), the CCE framework developed identifies and highlights three other approaches HEIs can deploy to embed CCE: Piggybacking, mainstreaming and connecting (transdisciplinary). Using data gathered in an explorative international survey involving participants working across academic and senior management, this paper illustrates the different approaches taken and analyses practical examples of current CCE practice from across the world. Responses from 212 university staff from 45 countries indicated that CCE was highly variable – no clear pattern was identified at the country level, with CCE approaches varying significantly, even within individual HEIs. This plurality highlights the wide range of ideas and examples being shared and used by institutions in very different countries and contexts, and underlines the importance of the independence and autonomy of HEIs so that they can choose the right CCE approaches for them. To highlight the breadth and variety of approaches that were uncovered by our survey, the paper offers a range of examples illustrating how climate change education may be embedded in a higher education context, some of which could be replicated in HEIs across the world. The conceptualisation of CCE and the examples given in this paper are valuable for anyone who is thinking about strategies for embedding more climate education in the higher education curriculum.},

Drawing on current literature, a framework of drivers and barriers is introduced, including seven distinct areas: environmental, economic, social, political and institutional, technological and informational, supply chain, and organizational factors. The appearance and content of these areas in practice have been examined in four case organizations by conducting thirty-six qualitative, semi-structured interviews.

abstract = {The use of fused-filament 3D printing (FF 3DP) to fabricate individual tablets is demonstrated. The technology permits the manufacture of tablets containing drug doses tailored to individual patients, or to fabrication of tablets with specific drug-release profiles. Commercially produced polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) filament was loaded with a model drug (fluorescein) by swelling of the polymer in ethanolic drug solution. A final drug-loading of 0.29{\%} w/w was achieved. Tablets of PVA/fluorescein (10 mm diameter) were printed using a 3D printer. It was found that changing the degree of infill percentage in the printer software varied the weight and volume of the printed tablets. The tablets were mechanically strong and no significant thermal degradation of the active occurred during printing. Dissolution tests were conducted in modified Hank's buffer. The results showed release profiles were dependent on the infill percentage used to print the tablet. The study indicates that FF 3DP has the potential to offer a new solution for fabricating personalized-dose medicines or unit dosage forms with controlled-release profiles. In addition, the low cost of FDM printers means the paradigm of extemporaneous or point-of-use manufacture of personalized-dose tablets is both feasible and attainable.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Graspable 3D objects overcome the limitations of 3D visualizations which can only be displayed on flat screens. 3D objects can be produced based on CT or MRI volumetric medical images. Using dedicated post-processing algorithms, a spatial model can be extracted from image data sets and exported to machine-readable data. That spatial model data is utilized by special printers for generating the final rapid prototype model. RESULTS: Patient-clinician interaction, surgical training, medical research and education may require graspable 3D objects. The limitations of rapid prototyping include cost and complexity, as well as the need for specialized equipment and consumables such as photoresist resins. CONCLUSIONS: Medical application of rapid prototyping is feasible for specialized surgical planning and prosthetics applications and has significant potential for development of new medical applications.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTFused deposition modelling is the most significant technique in additive manufacturing (AM) that refers to the process where successive layers of material are deposited in a computer-controlled environment to create a three-dimensional object. The main limitations of using fused deposition modelling (FDM) process in the industrial applications are the narrow range of available materials and parts fabricated by FDM are used only as demonstration or conceptual parts rather than as functional parts. Recently, researchers have studied many ways in order to increase the range of materials available for the FDM process which resulted in the increase in the scope of FDM in various manufacturing sectors. Most of the research are focussed on the composite materials such as metal matrix composites, ceramic composites, natural fibre-reinforced composites and polymer matrix composites. This article intends to review the research carried out so far in developing samples using different composite materials and ...},

abstract = {Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is a popular additive manufacturing technique where molten polymer filament is applied in a raster pattern, layer by layer, to obtain the work piece. A necessary consequence of this method is a pronounced mechanical anisotropy of the product; the interface between the filaments is weaker compared to the filament itself. The strength of this interface is governed by the reptation theory which postulates a more efficient interpenetration of polymeric surfaces with decreasing polymer viscosity. This relationship was utilized in this work to modify a polycarbonate-acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polymer blend to produce FFF work pieces with less mechanical anisotropy, independent of printer settings. The tensile strength ratio of the printed interface to bulk tensile strength could be increased from 41{\%} to 95{\%}. Though the absolute bulk tensile strength decreases slightly, this method presents an easy and effective way to address the mechanical problems inherent in the FFF-method.},

abstract = {Refrigerated Display Cabinets (RDCs) are used in the retail sector to display chilled and frozen food, and beverages. The manufacture of RDCs is typified by the extensive use of materials and energy, meaning that the development of a Circular Economy in this sector is particularly important. A number of behavioural barriers are preventing the development of the Circular Economy but an appropriate behaviour change intervention could help to overcome them. This paper investigates how effective the use of Persuasive Communication could be in influencing the Behavioural Attitudes, Product Perceptions and Behavioural Intentions towards the purchase of remanufactured RDCs. Participants in this study are engineers and academic experts of retail refrigeration equipment. The study was carried out in three consecutive stages. In the first stage participants completed a questionnaire, which assessed their Behavioural Attitudes, Product Perceptions and Behavioural Intentions. In the second stage participants were exposed to the intervention, which was the Persuasive Communication in the form of an audio-visual presentation. In the third stage participants completed a second questionnaire which assessed the impact of the intervention. The results show that the Persuasive Communication had a positive impact on the participants' Behavioural Attitudes, Product Perceptions and Behavioural Intentions towards the purchase of remanufactured RDCs. This paper demonstrates how effective this type of intervention could be, if developed further to create a target market and generate demand for remanufactured RDCs.},

In this investigation, considering that environmental activism is political in essence, I argue that the effect of motivations is moderated by the political context people face. Drawing upon political science theories, I hypothesize that psychological motivations (environmental concern and postmaterialist values) are more strongly associated with environmental activism engagement among individuals who trust the government less and in societies with more facilitative political opportunity structures (higher density of environmental NGOs and more democracy). With a series of multilevel analyses of data from 31 countries, I found robust support to these hypotheses.

In total, three kinds of staggered composites are designed by mimicking the structure of bone and nacre. These composite designs are realized by 3D printing a rigid plastic and a viscous elastomer simultaneously. Greatly-enhanced energy dissipation in the designed composites is observed from both the experimental results and theoretical prediction. The designed polymer composites have loss modulus up to ???500 MPa, higher than most of the existing polymers. In addition, their specific loss modulus (up to 0.43 km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) is among the highest of damping materials. The damping enhancement is attributed to the large shear deformation of the viscous soft matrix and the large strengthening effect from the rigid inclusion phase.},

This strategy enables a true comparison between parts printed with parts manufactured by compression molding, using the same grade of raw material. Printed samples were mechanically characterized and the influence of filament orientation, layer thickness, infill degree and material was assessed. Regarding the latter, two grades of PP were evaluated: a glass-fiber reinforced and a neat, non-reinforced, one. The results showed the potential of the FDM to compete with conventional techniques, especially for the production of small series of parts/components; also, it was showed that this technique allows the production of parts with adequate mechanical performance and, therefore, does not need to be restricted to the production of mockups and prototypes.},

abstract = {Several authors have identified limitations in the uptake of design for sustainability (DfS) in companies and value chains. In spite of the extensive literature on the subject, researchers and practitioners still do not share a common overview on the subject, which hinders operationalization efforts. This paper proposes that DfS adoption is more likely to be successful if informed by corporate sustainability management and design management theories. Therefore, an analytical framework has been developed and applied to systematically analyse ten published design for sustainability models, which were identified through an extensive literature review. The analytical framework is composed of nine building blocks, or elements, organized in three levels: strategic, tactical and operational. To facilitate a more detailed and objective analysis of the selected models against each element, 22 questions have been established. The findings show that while some authors have focused on abstract models that support companies in establishing a vision and concepts for (more) sustainable products and services, others offer more instrumental approaches to guide the different phases of design. On the level of the building blocks, there is a considerable alignment of the models with the analytical framework; the detailed mechanisms and processes for implementation, however, vary a lot. Overall, difficulties related to developing a sustainability vision that guides the design for sustainability process, co-creating with stakeholders and harmonizing environmental, social and economic criteria were identified. The social dimension of design for sustainability is still poorly established and tackled in a multi-level, non-systemized way. The paper concludes with promising research directions focusing on design for sustainability.},

What is becoming clear to many commentators as well as science fiction writers is how rapid prototyping, or 3D printing more generally, could permit many final objects to be made near to or even by consumers on just-in-time 'printing' machines. This revolution in making would have many implications for the economy-and-society in the future by seriously augmenting, or possibly replacing, current systems of manufactured production, long-distance transportation and consumption. These 3D technologies have featured in SF works, including Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age, Ian McDonald's Brasyl, Charles Stross's Rule 34 and Cory Doctorow's Makers. The article reports on current research seeking to understand the implications of what may be a major new sociotechnical system in the making. Some creative uses of SF are presented in a professional workshop setting. As well the article documents the use of SF as a methodological prototype in forecasting alternative scenarios of the future. SF prototyping could be a powerful tool in the social science repertoire when put into action in forecasting possible technology and business futures. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@book{Wolf2005,
abstract = {For several decades, plastics derived from fossil fuels have grown at a faster rate than any other group of bulk materials, and expectations are that this high growth trend will continue until 2020. This study is motivated by the idea that bio-based plastics, being derived from renewable resources, could serve to offset to a certain extent the nonrenewable energy use and greenhouse gas emissions of the EU plastics industry, as well as having other advantageous socio-economic effects such as diversifying agricultural land use. An overview of the types of bio-based polymers, their producers (including their location), the production processes applied and the types of uses shows that bio-based polymers is an emerging field which is characterised by new synergies and collaborations. In order to obtain a better understanding of the importance of this emerging sector estimates have been made firstly for the technical substitution potential and then for more realistic production scenarios which implicitly take into account price differentials and other influencing factors. The technical substitution potential, which can be derived from the material property set of each bio-based polymer and its petrochemicalbased equivalent is estimated at 15.4 million tonnes for EU-15, or 33{\%} of the total current polymer production. A more detailed analysis taking into account economic, social, ecological and technological influencing factors relating to the bio-based polymer value chain leads to the identification of three scenarios: WITHOUT P{\&}M (policies and measures), WITH P{\&}M and HIGH GROWTH. In absolute terms, biobased polymers are projected to reach a maximum of 1 million tonnes by 2010 in the scenario WITHOUT P{\&}M and max. 1.75-3.0 million tonnes by 2020 in the scenarios WITH P{\&}M and HIGH GROWTH respectively. These (physical) amounts are equivalent to an estimated maximum (monetary) production volume of roughly 1-2 billion EUR by 2010 (scenarios WITH P{\&}M and HIGH GROWTH) and 3-6 billion EUR by 2020 (scenario HIGH GROWTH).  While these are sizable quantities, they are modest compared to the expected production increase of petrochemical polymers by 12.5 million tonnes by 2010 and 25 million tonnes by 2020. Thus, the market share of bio-based polymers will remain very small, in the order of 1-2{\%} by 2010 and 1-4{\%} by 2020. This means that bio-based polymers will not provide a major challenge, nor present a major threat, to conventional petrochemical polymers. Energy and GHG emission savings from bio-based polymers in specific terms were found to be 20-50 GJ/t polymer and 1.0-4.0 t CO2eq/t polymer respectively (in Chapter 4.2.1). Bio-based polymers are thus very attractive in terms of specific energy and emissions savings. In absolute terms, savings are rather small: as a proportion of the total EU chemical industry, energy savings amount to 0.5-1.0{\%} by 2010, up to a maximum of 2.1{\%} by 2020; compared to the total EU economy the figures are 0.1{\%} until 2010 and 0.2{\%} until 2020 (Chapter 4.3.1). Greenhouse gas emissions savings amount to 1-2{\%} by 2010, up to a maximum of 5{\%} by 2020; compared to the total EU economy the figures are 0.1{\%} until 2010 and 0.2{\%} until 2020. Bio-based polymers therefore cannot offset the additional environmental burden due to the growth of petrochemical polymers (there is a gap of a factor of about 20 to 40). It is also out of the question that, within the next two decades, bio-based polymers will be able to meaningfully compensate for the environmental impacts of the economy as a whole.  However, it is not unthinkable that the boundary conditions for bio-based polymers and the energy system will change dramatically in the decades after 2020, e.g. due to substantially higher oil prices. If, ceteris paribus, bio-based polymers would ultimately grow ten times beyond the HIGH GROWTH projection for 2020 (i.e., to about 30 million tonnes), this could avoid half of the chemical sector's current GHG emissions, without accounting for major technological progress (efficiencies, yields) in the decades after 2020. These considerations for the very long term do not justify any concrete (policy) action today, they are rather intended to demonstrate the implications of the comparatively low production volumes until 2020 (compare also per capita values in Table 3-7). The results of the calculations on land use requirements (Chapter 4.3.1) show that by 2010 a maximum of 125,000 ha may be used for bio-based polymers in Europe and by 2020 an absolute maximum of 975,000 ha (High Growth Scenario). Comparing this with total land use in EU15 for various purposes, shows that if all bio-based polymers were to be produced from wheat, land requirements as a percentage of total land used to grow wheat range from 1{\%} WITH P{\&}M to 5{\%} in the case of HIGH GROWTH. As a proportion of total cereals these figures are a factor 2 lower. Compared to total set-aside land (1997 values), the percentage of land required ranges from 3.6{\%} to 15.4{\%}; as a percentage of industrial crops the range is similar. Bio-based polymers are thus seen to have modest land requirements and will not cause any strain within the EU on agricultural land requirements in the near future. As a consequence the employment potential in the agricultural sector is also very limited until 2020.  The assessment of the environmental impacts at the EU level is based on assumptions about the implementation of advanced technology (with lower environmental impact) and on the projections just discussed. At this early stage of development of bio-based polymers, many impacts which are likely to be significant cannot yet be assessed; other impact categories will only be identified as the transition from petroleum-based polymers to bio-based polymers progresses. The choice of reference product (1 tonne bulk polymer) and simplifying assumptions made in relation to the system boundaries do not allow for all end products to be taken into account; nor for all combinations of factors including locality, time, modes of transportation used and waste treatment technologies employed. The assessment of the environmental impacts is thus subject to large uncertainties. However, this uncertainty is inevitable since it is not feasible to account for all possible combinations of materials, end products and waste management, which, ideally, would need to be weighted with their respective future penetration rates. To develop a deeper understanding of the possible effects of policies and measures (P{\&}Ms) the society's willingness to pay for green electricity (from biomass) is translated to bio-based polymers; a level of 0.1-0.2 EUR per kg of bio-based polymer is found. It is concluded that this level of financial support would help to improve the competitiveness of bio-based polymers. A thorough discussion about the effects of P{\&}Ms would actually require a comprehensive overview of all existing fiscal measures and subsidies. A first attempt is made to quantify the effect related to the tax exemptions for the feedstock use of fossil fuels. According to our rough estimates this leads to an equivalent of 0.10 to 0.15 EUR/kg polymer, which – if verified – would have a number of important implications. The interviews and workshop held within the scope of this project also showed that it is not sufficient simply to lower the cost of bio-based polymers production and facilitate their market introduction. It is equally important to accompany this with R{\&}D activities in the field of polymer processing: Processors also must have access to the relevant additives which should be biodegradable, in order for the biopolymer to be fully biodegradable (examples given: dyes, anti-static additives). The report ends with an overview of relevant P{\&}Ms including brief explanations of the experience made to date in the EU and elsewhere. Finally, recent developments in policy making at the EU level are reported.},

abstract = {Increasing demand for various social services in accordance with the global social change in time requires a systematic and efficient system based on a user-oriented policy operation method beyond an administrative operation method of social services. Therefore, this study aimed to present a specific direction for the development of the social service system by empirically deriving and discussing the critical factors that can lead to sustainable success of the social service system. To this end, 12 factors in 3 areas were critically analyzed through a questionnaire survey and analysis on the basis of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method for the social service workers and users of the 50 Plus Foundation, an organization that helps the elderly in Seoul to continue their social participation. The analysis results confirmed that the service delivery system was the most important factor among the service delivery system, service administration, and service network, and, in particular, factors for users' active system access, such as accessibility and participation possibility, were the most influential factors for sustainable success of the social service system. Ultimately, unlike in the past, system development and direction should be sought by considering service users rather than a one-sided policy approach of the government for the development and operation of the social service system.},

abstract = {One of the milestones in tissue engineering has been the development of 3D scaffolds that guide cells to form functional tissue. Recently, mouldless manufacturing techniques, known as solid free-form fabrication (SFF), or rapid prototyping, have been successfully used to fabricate complex scaffolds. Similarly, to achieve simultaneous addition of cells during the scaffold fabrication, novel robotic assembly and automated 3D cell encapsulation techniques are being developed. As a result of these technologies, tissue-engineered constructs can be prepared that contain a controlled spatial distribution of cells and growth factors, as well as engineered gradients of scaffold materials with a predicted microstructure. Here, we review the application, advancement and future directions of SFF techniques in the design and creation of scaffolds for use in clinically driven tissue engineering.},

abstract = {The combustion process of virgin and reprocessed polylactide (PLA) was simulated by multi-rate linear non-isothermal thermogravimetric experiments under O(2). A complete methodology that accounted on the thermal stability and emission of gases was thoroughly developed. A new model, Thermal Decomposition Behavior, and novel parameters, the Zero-Decomposition Temperatures, were used to test the thermal stability of the materials under any linear heating rate. The release of gases was monitored by Evolved Gas Analysis with in-line FT-IR analysis. In addition, a kinetic analysis methodology that accounted for variable activation parameters showed that the decomposition process could be driven by the formation of bubbles in the melt. It was found that the combustion technologies for virgin PLA could be transferred for the energetic valorization of its recyclates. Combustion was pointed out as appropriate for the energetic valorization of PLA submitted to more than three successive reprocessing cycles.},

abstract = {Governments in countries across the world increasingly adopt the “green growth” discourse to underline their ambition for the greening of their economies. The central tenet of this narrative is the economic opportunities rather than challenges arising from the pursuit of environmental sustainability. Our paper synthesises insights from 113 recent scientific articles, dealing with both environmental issues and economic growth, as well as innovation. Our ambition is exploratory in attempting to take stock of heterogeneous contributions across the spectrum of social science. The articles have been reviewed with a focus on six themes, derived from current discussions in economic geography and transition studies: skills, technology, physical resources, markets, institutions and policies. Four major implications emerge from the review. First, green growth requires competences that allow for handling complex, non-routine situations – in both the private and the public sector. Second, technological progress should be directed towards greener technologies, to avoid investments funds being channelled to brown technologies for short-term returns. Third, our knowledge of the opportunities for achieving green growth must base upon a joint assessment of market failures, structural system failures and transformational system failures. Finally, greater attention should be devoted to the geography of green growth processes at different scales.},

In a study of over 50 years of product innovation in the whitewater kayaking field, we find users in aggregate were approximately 3× more efficient at developing important kayaking product innovations than were producers in aggregate. We speculate that this result is driven by what we term "efficiencies of scope" in problem-solving. These can favor an aggregation of many user innovators, each spending a little, over fewer producer innovators benefitting from higher economies of scale in product development. We also note that the present study explores only one initial point on what is likely to be a complex efficiency landscape. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The history of aluminum is rather short since it was discovered only in the nineteenth century, yet it has become an important part of everyday life. This article reviews the history of aluminum through technological breakthroughs as well as from cultural and social perspectives, beginning with its discovery, through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries until today; and aims to suggest possible future trends and applications for aluminum alloys. Aluminum has a high strength-to-weight ratio combined with excellent thermal conductivity and good corrosion resistance. Therefore, aluminum is an attractive material for many applications, including transportation, electrical and packaging industries, architecture, and food industries. It is also a recyclable metal, which provides both environmental and economic advantages. The commercial use of aluminum started at the end of the nineteenth century and continues to grow today with the development of new advanced aluminum alloys. Consequently, from a cultural perspective, aluminum is considered a symbol of modernity. Technological breakthroughs generate economic growth and social benefits. Present applications of aluminum include new choices, such as 3D printing, composite materials, nano-rods, biomedicine devices and aerospace uses. Based on the excellent properties of aluminum, its low price, combined with its significant scrap value and a growing recycling market, as well as its accelerating global production, it is expected that the aluminum industries will considerably grow through the twenty-first century and aluminum will continue to be a major part of our everyday culture. Therefore, based on the increasing growth of aluminum production and consumption, additional research and development effort is needed in the following years to minimize the negative environmental side effects associated with the technological developments related to aluminum production and at the same time creating further technological innovation.},

abstract = {Direct digital manufacturing, or ‘3D printing' as it is more commonly known, offers a wealth of opportunities for product and process innovation, and is often touted to ‘revolutionize' today's manufacturing operations and its associated supply chains structures. Despite a growing number of successful 3D printing applications, however, evidence of any displacement of traditional manufacturing is limited. In this paper we seek to separate hype surrounding DDM from economic reality in order to ground the future research agenda for the Operations Management field. By opposing direct digital manufacturing with traditional tool-based manufacturing, we show that direct digital manufacturing so far lags behind by several orders of magnitude compared to traditional manufacturing methods. Yet we also find that direct digital manufacturing clearly is on an improvement trajectory that eventually will see it being able to compete with traditional manufacturing on a unit cost basis. As such we conclude that direct digital manufacturing will increasingly challenge operations management researchers to question established practices such as scheduling, batch sizing and inventory management in low-volume, high-variety contexts. Furthermore, an increasing adoption of direct digital manufacturing will drive structural shifts in the supply chain that are not yet well understood. We summarize these challenges by defining the research agenda at factory, supply chain, and operations strategy level.},

abstract = {In recent years, additive manufacturing technology has been highly focused on its strong capability in complex geometry manufacturing and great suitability for customised product fabrication. Researchers have recognised the key role of additive manufacturing in leading the next-generation manufacturing, and have conducted extensive research from different aspects, including product design, process development, material modelling and many others. Several design-for-additive manufacturing methods have been proposed, specifically about design, and different computer-aided programmes have been developed, such as geometric modelling-based design, bio-inspired design, evolutionary algorithm-driven design and topology optimisation. However, authors have observed that many of these methods are named ‘design for additive manufacturing' without specifying the exact additive manufacturing process. This could be problematic since a general design method cannot reflect the best practice given a specific additive manufacturing process. In this review paper, material extrusion polymer 3D printing is focused specifically. The motive of this paper is to conduct a literature survey about design methods for material extrusion polymer 3D printing, summarising the state of the art and pointing out the underdeveloped research topics; more importantly, some general design-for-additive manufacturing methods will be discussed, especially for their adaption to the material extrusion process.},

abstract = {The circular economy (CE) paradigm fosters to rethink and redesign the manufacturing process, usage and disposal pattern of products and services in an economy. In the past few years, CE has gained tremendous momentum in terms of research and implementation. Apart from the widening horizon of CE across the globe, numerous practitioners, policy-makers and academicians have explored the scope to incorporate various sectors of industries and businesses within the CE model. Evidently, a primary mechanism or system is required to facilitate the transition to CE. With an aim to understand this mechanism, the article analyzes, through a systematic literature review, the implementation of circular practices across the European Union (EU) member states based on a framework of circular strategies, nutrient cycles, ReSOLVE framework and circular business models. Further, the implementation of CE action plan proposed in 2015 for the EU region, has facilitated circular practices in numerous industries, owing to government policies and regulations. Additionally, it has helped in building the required infrastructure, while providing a technological push for augmenting sustainable growth in the region. Based on the analysis, it is inferred that recycling has been the most widely used circular strategy for looping back materials into the system. Waste management, electrical and electronic equipment industries and construction industries are a pioneer in CE implementation. Also, macro level initiatives by governments and/or regional administrative bodies predominate CE's implementation in the EU. A further transition to CE can be facilitated by government policies, infrastructure and technological availability, awareness, stakeholder collaboration and supply-chain integration.},

abstract = {Packaging enables the movement of product from its point of origin to its point of consumption and influences all other industries directly or indirectly. Despite technological advancements, increasing length of global supply chains for products has led to a simultaneous increase in the use of packaging layers and associated waste along the supply chain. Thus, packaging poses challenges and opportunities to the environment and society, with implications for supply chain costs. With growing popularity of concepts such as circular economy and sustainability, packaging and its relationship with sustainability and supply chain management in a circular economy needs to be studied. This paper presents a systematic literature review of studies done over the last 18 years with the objective to generate a greater understanding of the work done in the field of sustainable packaging in supply chain management (SPSCM). Our findings indicate SPSCM trends are aligned to circular economy concepts but have not adequately considered the interaction of the product with its packaging system. Research efforts in SPSCM are restricted to environmental and economic dimensions and are mostly concentrated in developed economies. The review identifies three main supply chain structures studied in SPSCM literature of which there has been an increased focus on fragmented portions and dyads of the supply chain with respect to packaging. The research contributes by identifying and mapping the collated literature to organizational theories that support and drive SPSCM. In particular, the institutional theory, stakeholder theory and ecological modernization theory are investigated from a SPSCM perspective. Further, the three organizational theories are used to develop a framework for circular economy to highlight future avenues for research and practice in SPSCM for a circular economy.},

abstract = {This study investigated best practices in teaching environmental responsibility to inventors and innovators. Because successful invention includes engineering, design, and business, best practices in all three disciplines were investigated, as well as connections among them. The investigation sought best practices in curriculum, delivery methods, and administrative leadership to maximize environmental responsibility in invention education. To find best practices, interviews of 25 instructors, administrators, and graduates from sustainable innovation and entrepreneurship programs were performed; a small literature review provided background and validation. Results found that for curriculum, there was no “silver bullet” but a wide spread of topics for different contexts; however, core topics included business knowledge, measurement of impacts, systems thinking, communication, and inclusion of social justice for broader sustainability. For delivery methods, project-based learning in interdisciplinary teams was a best practice, especially when partnering with industry or other external stakeholders. For leadership, faculty leading with strong administrative support was often praised, though other models were also described, and barriers were mentioned. Leadership best practices also included involvement of all aspects of institutions: faculty, administration, students, facilities, and operations.},

abstract = {The European Union (EU) has set its sights on becoming a circular economy, envisaging a transition that implies systemic changes in natural resource transformations and material flows; and offering a response to what is commonly labelled as the ‘take-make-dispose' conventional economic model. What does the transition toward a circular economy entail and what can it do? This paper analyses the emergence and mobilisation of expectations that are shaping the EU transition to a circular economy. It traces the narrative elements through which the circular economy is configured through an analysis of position papers presented to inform the debate on the European Commission's circular economy package. Expectations for the circular economy are articulated as: (1) a perfect circle of slow material flows; (2) a shift from consumer to user; (3) growth through circularity and decoupling; and (4) a solution to European renewal. Extending boundaries of what is ‘in' benefits actors driving the circular economy as, in the short-term, they can actively support a deliberately vague, but uncontroversial, circular economy. On the one hand, the expectations present a strong sense of a collective ‘we', on the other hand we are yet to see the contentions and contestations being full playing out.},

abstract = {A simulation of the degradation of high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), occurring during service life and mechanical recycling, was performed by multiple processing and thermo-oxidative ageing. All samples were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), melt mass-flow rate (MFR) measurements, tensile testing and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Multiple processing and thermo-oxidative ageing clearly alter the oxidative stability and the elongation at break of the materials. These changes observed at a macroscopic scale have been related to chemical alterations in the structure of HIPS. The polybutadiene phase was demonstrated to be the initiation point of the degradative processes induced by processing, service life and mechanical recycling. Thermo-oxidative degradation affects more severely the degree of degradation of the material, so it may be deduced that the changes occurring during service life of HIPS are the part of the life cycle that mostly affects its further recycling possibilities and performance in second-market applications. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The circular economy (CE) has recently become a popular discourse especially in government and corporate sectors. Given the socio-ecological challenges of the Anthropocene, the concept of CE could indeed help the transition to a sustainable, just and resilient future. However, the actual definition, objectives and forms of implementation of the CE are still unclear, inconsistent, and contested. Different actors and sectors are thus articulating circular discourses which align with their interests, and which often do not sufficiently examine the ecological, social and political implications of circularity. In this context, this research asks how to better navigate and analyse the history, complexity and plurality of circularity discourses by conceptually differentiating them in a comprehensive discourse typology. To answer this question a critical literature review has been carried out, which first, examines and reflects on the core challenges, gaps and limitations of the CE concept. Second, this research develops a comprehensive timeline of circularity thinking, which identifies and conceptually classifies 72 different CE-related concepts from the Global North and South (such as Gandhian and steady-state economics, buen vivir, doughnut economics and degrowth). This leads to the development of a typology of circularity discourses, which classifies circularity visions according to their position on fundamental social, technological, political and ecological issues. This research thus seeks to provide a basis for a more inclusive and comprehensive discussion on the topic, which opens the imaginary regarding the many circular futures that can exist and allows for a cross-pollination of ideas, policy options, strategies, practices and solutions.},

It draws on the sociology of space in exploring the social practices, institutional forces and material complexity of how people and spaces interact. We assess how space influences the development of innovative solutions to challenges in the health sector. Our aim is to advance an understanding of the social production of space for healthcare innovation. We draw empirical examples from the Innovation Hub at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town to illustrate that innovation does not take place in an institutional vacuum, but requires space that facilitates interaction of different players. This paper demonstrates that space matters in promoting innovation, particularly through its influence on social relationships and networks. An attractive and novel space, which is different from the usual workplace, stimulates innovation, mainly through being a base for the creation of an ecosystem for the productive interaction of different players. The interaction is important in inspiring new ideas, facilitating creative thought processes, maintaining the flow of information and bringing innovation to life.},

abstract = {Both the free and open source software (FOSS) as well as the distributed digital manufacturing of free and open source hardware (FOSH) has shown particular promise among scientists for developing custom scientific tools. Early research found substantial economic savings for these technologies, but as the open source design paradigm has grown by orders of magnitude it is possible that the savings observed in the early work was isolated to special cases. Today there are examples of open source technology for science in the vast majority of disciplines and several resources dedicated specifically to publishing them. Do the tremendous economic savings observed earlier hold today? To answer that question, this study evaluates free and open source technologies in the two repositories compared to proprietary functionally-equivalent tools as a function of their use of Arduino-based electronics, RepRap-class 3-D printing, as well as the combination of the two. The results of the review find overwhelming evidence for a wide range of scientific tools, that open source technologies provide economic savings of 87{\%} compared to equivalent or lesser proprietary tools. These economic savings increased slightly to 89{\%} for those that used Arduino technology and even more to 92{\%} for those that used RepRap-class 3-D printing. Combining both Arduino and 3-D printing the savings averaged 94{\%} for free and open source tools over commercial equivalents. The results provide strong evidence for financial support of open source hardware and software development for the sciences. Given the overwhelming economic advantages of free and open source technologies, it appears financially responsible to divert funding of proprietary scientific tools and their development in favor of FOSH. Policies were outlined that provide nations with a template for strategically harvesting the opportunities provided by the free and open source paradigm.},

abstract = {Climate change is one of the greatest threats to humanity and requires immediate action. Schuldt, Konrath, and Schwarz (2011) suggested that beliefs in environmental phenomena can be influenced by the terminology used to describe it: changing question wording from global warming to climate change resulted in a 6.3 percentage point increase in belief in environmental phenomena. This association was moderated by political self-identification, with Republicans being 16.2 percentage points more likely to believe in climate change than in global warming, with Democrats showing no difference. The potential for connotative meanings to shift over time and the sociopolitical changes since the original study, potential policy and environmental campaign implications, and an expansion of these findings to other countries, motivated an attempt to replicate this important finding. This pre-registered study repeated the original procedures in the United States of America and two other countries (United Kingdom and Australia; total N = 5,717). Although question wording no longer had a significant effect on beliefs in climate change/global warming, the association of political self-identification with beliefs in environmental phenomena replicated in all three countries, with Conservatives consistently believing less in climate change/global warming than Liberals. The potential impacts of temporal and methodological differences on the discrepancies between this study's and the original's findings are discussed.},

The economic development, environment, and employment aspects of sustainable development are emphasized. We contend that the most crucial problem in achieving sustainability is lock-in or path dependency due to (1) the failure to envision, design, and implement policies that achieve co-optimization, or the mutually reinforcing, of social goals, and (2) entrenched economic and political interests that gain from the present system and advancement of its current trends. The article argues that industrial policy, environmental law and policy, and trade initiatives must be 'opened up' by expanding the practice of multi-purpose policy design, and that these policies must be integrated as well. Sustainable development requires stimulating revolutionary technological innovation through environmental, health, safety, economic, and labor market regulation. Greater support for these changes must also be reinforced by 'opening up the participatory and political space' to enable new voices to contribute to integrated thinking and solutions. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the authors.},

This paper examines the structuring of a business strategy for adaptation in a Brazilian thermoplastic resin and petrochemical company to exemplify the extent to which internal changes in the organization's understanding, norms and values derived from a social learning process. Hence, the main research question is “how are learning processes within a company—organizational learning—and social interaction in a Community of Practice—social learning—related and how do they contribute to leveraging changes in management practices in a company's adaptation to climate change?” The case study presents how the company's representatives' participation in a social learning process within a CoP supported not only the development of a comprehensive adaptation strategy but also the mainstreaming of climate concepts, impacts and adaptation actions. Therefore, it demonstrated that combining social learning and organization learning processes is useful to consistently build resilience, given that they are mutually supportive in the recognition of the relevance of adaptation, the dissemination of risk perception throughout the organization and the development of an internal capacity to continuously plan and act.},

It is designed, built, and tested for its ability to convert post-consumer waste, 3D printed products and waste into polymer feedstock for recyclebots of fused particle/granule printers. The technical specifications of the device are quantified in terms of power consumption (380 to 404 W for PET and PLA, respectively) and particle size distribution. The open source device can be fabricated for less than {\$}2000 USD in materials. The experimentally measured power use is only a minor contribution to the overall embodied energy of distributed recycling of waste plastic. The resultant plastic particle size distributions were found to be appropriate for use in both recyclebots and direct material extrusion 3D printers. Simple retrofits are shown to reduce sound levels during operation by 4dB-5dB for the vacuum. These results indicate that the open source waste plastic granulator is an appropriate technology for community, library, maker space, fab lab, or small business–based distributed recycling.},

This paper presents an exploratory and conceptual framework providing propositions to gain a better understanding concerning the factors driving and hindering interactions and the willingness to collaborate between university-industry actors. In addition, this research discusses the relevance of the type of impact (economic, technological and societal) of this collaboration as agents of an eco-system accomplishing innovation goals. It concludes with theoretical, managerial and policy implications based on asymmetries on expectations, benefits, capabilities, norms and actors-agency. Such asymmetries affect the entrepreneurial predisposition to interact and strive to achieve societal desirable collaboration outcomes. A preliminary collective actions framework is proposed. Such framework renders a useful tool for universities, industry and government in the management of knowledge transfer and collaboration.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Plastic solid waste (PSW) of polymers (like: high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), Nylon etc.) is creating new challenges, which in today's scenario are major research concerns. A sharp rise has been observed in production of different products based on different plastic material. This huge increase in plastic commodities also increases the waste generation thus creating new challenges. Some researchers have reported work in the field of PSW management with different recycling methods. This paper compiles the different research work done by researchers in this field of recycling and progress in recovery and management of PSW by different methods (i.e. Primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary) along with the various identification/separation techniques. Further, this paper reviews the effect on properties of virgin and recycled HDPE/LDPE/Nylon PSW with different reinforcements like sand, natural fibre, hemp fibre, metal powder etc.},

abstract = {In the past few years many groundbreaking promises have been made about the potential of the Smart City. The future of cities relies perceivably on ubiquitous sensing, and anytime-anywhere information access and control. However, city leaders are still struggling to identify the quantifiable sources of value that novel ICT can generate. Current Smart City investment is characterized by relatively small demonstrators that often lack the scalability to have real and long lasting impacts on the economy. In this paper we adopt the view of a Smart City as an information marketplace and look at how we might use existing and tested concepts of fostering technology innovation to support city leaders in navigating this unknown territory. In particular we use systems thinking to scope how the concepts of the Living Lab and the nnovation Distric can work together in a complementary fashion to create a candidate model for the implementation of the Smart City. ?? 2013 The authors.

abstract = {This study considers the feasibility of using 100{\%} recycled Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (rABS) in the caseworks of small consumer electronic products as a step towards more circular design and manufacturing. A Digitally Enhanced Cordless Telephone (DECT) handset was chosen as a representative example of such a product. Materials testing on the rABS demonstrated that 100{\%} recycled ABS has similar properties to virgin ABS and can be substituted for virgin ABS as long as the product design allows for the slightly stiffer nature of the rABS and addresses issues of surface finish and ability to colour. By clearly understanding these issues at the outset of the design process, and by adapting the designs appropriately at the outset, it was possible to produce an rABS handset which was as robust and as cosmetically acceptable as one made of virgin ABS. This suggests that the recycled material could be used widely in this type of product and also at reduced cost to using virgin ABS. Furthermore, an abridged Life Cycle Analysis of the existing handset suggested that other issues associated with the environmental impact of the product could be relatively easily addressed at the design stage by considering energy use and end of life issues.},

abstract = {The lack of quantitative mechanisms aimed at evaluating the potential business benefits of ecodesign prior to implementation is a major barrier to wider adoption in manufacturing companies. Ecodesign is defined as the consistent integration of environmental aspects into product development processes. Within this frame, there is a need to understand how the development of ecodesign capabilities affect overall business performance over time. Drawing upon the Ecodesign Maturity Model (EcoM2) as the theoretical foundation, this paper systematically reviews the literature on (i) relevant applications of dynamic modelling and (ii) relationships between ecodesign management practices and key business performance outcomes, in order to develop a simulation-based approach aimed at deriving a business case framework for ecodesign implementation. The resulting framework originates the “business case simulator”, which was subjected to the judgement and evaluation of six industry experts regarding its applicability and usefulness to manufacturing settings. The results are discussed and future research streams – coupled with improvement opportunities to the business case simulator – are pointed.},

abstract = {The 'open approach' is rooted in the open-source and free-software movements. Its application has spread to more fields than computer engineering. Product design is impacted as well: we observe new stakeholders and practices challenging current structured design processes and leading to industrial successes. Open-design appears to be promising yet disruptive. Moreover, its distinctive features remain unclear. This paper aims to popularize this new concept, as well as to give both researchers and practitioners an overview of current research on open-design, and its consequences on design. For this, we conducted a systematic quantitative bibliometric analysis of 624 entries corresponding to the keyword 'open-design' in the Scopus database. This supports a qualitative synthesis of scientific literature, enabling us to summarize practices falling under the umbrella term 'open-design'. As such, this paper traces the evolution of product design and the open approach. It also analyzes the impact of open-design on the design process as presented in the scientific literature. Finally, this paper develops a typology of open-design of tangible artifacts that distinguishes among three currently reported varieties of practice: do-it-yourself, meta-design, and industrial ecosystems. As the major contribution of this paper, this typology is developed as a final discussion.},

abstract = {In recent years, due to the excessive consumption of chemical fertilizers in Iran, the environment and human health have been in serious danger. Therefore, the main idea of this study is to find determining factors in the safe use of chemical fertilizers. An extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) by adding risk perception (RP) and moral norm (MN) has been utilized as a study's theoretical framework. The research was conducted using questionnaire survey method and by the help of structural equation modeling (SEM). The statistical population of the research was all wheat farmers in Khuzestan province (located in southwest of Iran). Using Krejcie and Morgan table, the sample size was estimated 410 individuals. In this study, the sampling method was multistage stratified clustered. The results of Extended TPB variables among respondents showed that only two variables of attitude and MN are in proper status. The results indicated that the original TPB explains 0.69{\%} of the variance of farmers' behavioral intention in the safely use of chemical fertilizers. The three main structures of the original TPB included attitude, perceived behavioral control (PBC), and subjective norms (SN), all of which had positive impacts on farmers' intention. Most importantly, the extended TPB by adding RP and MN increases the model's ability to explain farmers' safe behavioral intention by 11.2{\%}. In this study, the most important variables in initial TPB included attitude and subjective norms, but in the extended TPB, moral norm and risk perception were the most important. Therefore, policymakers by emphasizing these variables can promote safe behaviors in using chemical fertilizers.},

abstract = {Boundary organizations are non-traditional structures that can foster transdisciplinary relationships and help catalyze the exchange of ideas, trust, and ultimately the implementation of scientific evidence into policy. Here, we describe GE-21, a group composed of researchers and public servants interested in promoting biodiversity and ecosystem services in Geneva, Switzerland, as an example of such a structure. GE-21 developed into a de facto social experiment for fostering inter- and transdisciplinary science and promoting nature-based policies. The results of two ecosystem-based projects carried by GE-21 were rapidly adopted into policy. Here, we provide a post-hoc narrative based on reports, interviews, and observations that collectively assess the merits and drawbacks of such structures for mainstreaming ecosystem services. We contend that the following five characteristics of this boundary organization may have facilitated its role as a conduit between academic research and public agencies: 1) projects proposing timely, relevant, and novel solutions to policy needs; 2) institutional support for applied interdisciplinary research; 3) a ‘safe space' to express ideas and develop close relationships over time; 4) availability of high-quality spatial data at a relevant scale, and scientific capacity to treat them; 5) resources dedicated to communication.},

This paper reports the results of a UK-based deliberative process involving experts from a wide range of policy domains and across societal sectors: government departments, associated agencies, national and international NGOs, professional institutions, academia and independent experts. A symposium, based on a collaborative learning approach, explored instances in which ecosystem values have successfully been embedded into public policy, identified challenges to their more widespread embedding despite commitments to do so over generational timescales, and took a backcasting approach to develop actionable outcomes required to deliver transformation change across state and civil society. Emergent themes were expressed in social, technological, environmental, economic and political terms. Recommendations for interventions in complex social-ecological systems are cross-sectoral in scope and will necessarily entail multiple agents of change, well beyond governmental leadership, within any given sphere of societal activity and interest. We identify strategic challenges for, and between, a spectrum of societal policy areas, many currently overlooking ecosystem dependencies, impacts and potential benefits.

Yet very little is known about the companies that put circular principles at the heart of doing business and their ecological and social sustainability outcomes. Circular entrepreneurship, conceptualised as the processes of exploration and exploitation of opportunities in the circular economy domain, is just emerging in the circular economy literature and the empirical evidence about how it is implemented through innovative business models is still limited. Our research illustrates and describes the entrepreneurial process and orientation from a business model perspective of a circular firm - Wasted Apple - in the British drinks and beverage industry. We find that entrepreneurial value proposition, value creation and delivery and value capture define our case circular business model. Entrepreneurial orientation is also characterised by embeddedness: being entrepreneurial in the circular economy means to create value for the broader system an organisation is part of. Furthermore, the pursuit of ecological and social value is central to the logic of value creation and typifies the entrepreneurial process.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional printing (3DP) has been employed to fabricate porous scaffolds by inkjet printing liquid binder droplets onto particulate matter. Direct 3DP, where the final scaffold materials are utilized during the actual 3DP process, imposes several limitations on the final scaffold structure. This study describes an indirect 3DP protocol, where molds are printed and the final materials are cast into the mold cavity to overcome the limitations of the direct technique. To evaluate the resolution available in this technique, scaffolds with villi features (500 ??m diameter, 1 mm height) were produced by solvent casting into plaster molds, followed by particulate leaching. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed highly open, well interconnected, uniform pore architecture (???100-150 ??m). The ability of these scaffolds to support intestinal epithelial cell (IEC6) culture was investigated in vitro. IEC6 cells attached to scaffolds uniformly in vitro and grew preferentially in the villi region. To exploit the freeform nature of this technique with large pore size, anatomically shaped zygoma scaffolds with 300-500 ??m interconnected pores were produced and characterized. Indirect 3DP provides an alternative method to complement other direct solid freeform fabrication methods. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Industrial structure green adjustment (ISGA) and green total factor productivity (GTFP), deriving from development processes for green goals, recently attracted great attention as two ways to achieve Ecological Well-being Performance (EWP) growth, which is one of the main green development goals that humanity should pursue, and which affects the efficiency improvement of transforming ecological consumption into human well-being. In this paper, the effects of ISGA and GTFP on EWP growth are empirically tested in a dynamic panel model of spatial econometrics, using statistics from 30 provinces of China in the 1994–2014 period. In particular, the indicator system of ISGA is firstly constructed based on the theories of EWP and three-dimensional industrial ecological footprint (3DIEF). The results indicate that spatial spillovers are important factors in the effects, the main driving force for EWP growth in provinces of China had gradually shifted from ISGA to GTFP, and GTFP is essential for structural bonuses from ISGA to take effect. In addition, a provincial government needs to target reference objects from not only other provinces in the same economic zone's yardstick competition, but also ISGA and GTFP situations in geographically close or economically similar provinces. In addition, the adverse EWP effects of ISGA can be mitigated by GTFP increase or a combination of GTFP and ISGA for provinces in all stages of ISGA. In general, improving GTFP will be the main driving force for China's provincial EWP growth, and the main venue through which the adverse effects of improper ISGA can be mitigated. The present study contributes to explore the EWP growth effect of ISGA and GTFP, can at least provide a valuable guidance and in-depth understanding to researchers, operators and policy makers who wish to improve human well-being in an ecologically efficient way, as well as for the follow-up studies.},

abstract = {The debate on innovation systems has recently been improved through the development of more dynamic and forward-looking approaches. Scholars and researchers have started to reserve attention for System Dynamics, a widely used methodology for modelling complex socioeconomic systems. Moreover, recent innovation models such as the Quintuple Helix framework call for an effort for better understanding and forecasting relationships among ecology, knowledge and innovation, deeply analysing synergies among economy, society, and democracy. This paper focuses on the relationships between the Quintuple Helix and System Dynamics modelling from a quantitative perspective. It discusses how the application of Network Analysis metrics advances the understanding of an innovation system mapped with a Quintuple Helix model. Using Global Innovation Index, a Casual Loop Diagram has been designed representing the process of knowledge generation and innovation dissemination within the Quintuple Helix model. Identification of structural features within Causal Loop Diagrams through Network Analysis is likely to provide new insights into the emergent properties of an innovation system seen as a complex system. Meanwhile, analysing central drivers has the potential to identify leverage points. Results obtained show the benefits of coupling Network Analysis with System Dynamics modelling and valuable evidence of relationships among helices.},

abstract = {The number of coworking spaces and the number of people who choose to work in them has exploded over the past few years, with numbers expected to double every year. What is fuelling this growth and where is the demand for coworking coming from? We tried to address this question by looking at the specific needs of the rising creative class, identifying their urgent need for uninhibited sharing of information, knowledge, ideas and also material resources. We argue that coworking spaces are favoured by the creative class, because they offer a community of work which facilitates the culture of sharing. To illustrate what it takes to establish such a community of work, we present a case study of the Creative Centre Poligon which suggests that community building is a multi-step process that needs careful management and plenty of time. We conclude that policy makers should not focus on building coworking spaces in order to combat youth unemployment but should rather support existing initiatives that have been built or are in the process of building up vibrant communities of work.},

abstract = {Many higher education institutions have started to develop academic curricula, research capacity and outreach activities related to circular economy. However, little is known yet on how to apply circular economy thinking to sustainable campus management. In an attempt to address this gap, this paper proposes a methodological framework and guidance to help universities develop a circular economy strategy aimed at improving resource efficiency and environmental sustainability of their campus operations. The approach is compatible with sustainability management frameworks as it follows the well-known iterative process of planning, doing, checking and improving. The framework involves three main steps: analysis of current situation with respect to circular economy within the organisation; stakeholder engagement to get a buy-in and inform the development of a circular economy strategy; and implementation of the strategy following the guidelines provided within the framework. Application of the framework is illustrated through a case of the University of Manchester, demonstrating how circular economy principles can be used to benchmark existing sustainability policies and action plans. The paper also shows how engaging key stakeholders can be used to identify challenges and opportunities for embedding circular economy thinking into the university's sustainability management systems. The proposed framework and the guidelines for implementation of circular economy thinking are generic and can be applied by any institution across the higher education sector.},

abstract = {To evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of the waste management solutions, it is necessary to assess the quantity and the flows of the waste generated. This research developed a web application which serves as a decision support system for those involved in the planning and management of municipal solid waste. In contrast to present web-based solutions, this tool provides the necessary information regarding the supply chain that is required to assess the suitability of waste valorisation in a particular location such as waste types, waste quantities and related waste contractors. Using publicly available data, a web geographic information system was designed where factors that affect the supply chain of municipal solid waste can be investigated. These include spatial and temporal variation of waste generated. The concept was demonstrated in the developed web application using publicly available data about England. Waste market opportunities were identified, for example Kent County Council and Essex County Council were identified to have the highest quantity of incinerated waste with and without energy recovery (344 and 65 kiloton) respectively. Then Staffordshire and Lancashire County Councils were identified to have the highest quantity of hazardous and non-hazardous waste being landfilled (5 and 296 kiloton) respectively. Seasonal variation was inconsistent across counties, with East Northamptonshire having little seasonal variation in household waste ({\textless}500 tonne variation) as opposed to East Riding of Yorkshire which had higher waste volumes in summer with up to 15,000 tonne variation). Circular economy partners were also identified through the web application and these results are presented in context of waste-derived supply chain decisions. The web application is therefore able to provide a comprehensive tool for improving both strategic and logistical decision-making process for municipal solid waste management.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is an advanced technology where products are manufactured by building up thin layers of materials from digitized three-dimensional (3D) designs virtually constructed using advanced computer-aided design software. This freeform fabrication enhances dramatically the potential of design, pushing the boundaries of manufacturability. The aim of this paper was to provide a decision-making framework for the selection of an effective portfolio of production strategies, including alternative AM and traditional manufacturing technologies. To that end, a methodological framework is proposed which combines multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) for the determination of the optimal production strategy within the concept of "focused" factory. In this light, modern AM technologies are assessed for a number of selected criteria (e.g. production cost, lead time, quality) together with existing production strategies that involve conventional production methods, such as injection molding, CNC machining, etc. The adopted framework is applied on a real-world case regarding the production of security keyboard polymer housings. According to the findings, modern AM technologies provide efficient manufacturing solutions for small production volumes, thus enhancing supply chain responsiveness through make-to-order strategy and customization possibilities. Furthermore, AM seems capable to contribute also to traditional mass production systems, by improving significantly the productivity of injection molds. The proposed framework could not only assist decision-makers in the selection of the optimal production strategy, but it could also provide crucial benchmarks for different production alternatives.},

This empirical study aims to investigate the factors influencing the intentions in separating waste of residential households in Vietnam's capital city, Hanoi. The waste separation intentions of respondents were judged by the amount of the cash fine that each household was willing to pay as a commitment to participation. An econometric analysis was employed to demonstrate that trust, personal moral norms, perceived difficulties and reciprocity are important factors explaining the residents' behavioral intentions in waste separation. These findings suggest that apart from the improvement of institutional capacity and guarantee of satisfactory facilities and vehicles, communication campaigns to consolidate trust and inspire moral obligations of residents also have an essential role to play in overcoming the common dilemmas of solid waste management in a typical city of a developing country such as Hanoi, Vietnam.},

A systematic literature search was performed based on classification according to the type of 3D printing polymer. The most significant process parameters considered as influencing FDM specimens' tensile, compression, flexural or impact strengths are discussed considering the results presented in the literature. A necessary distinction between the mechanical properties of material and testing specimens (as given by producers and by experiments) and the mechanical behavior of a FDM end-part is also made.},

abstract = {In this study we use a thermodynamic framework to characterize the material and energy resources used in manufacturing processes. The analysis and data span a wide range of processes from "conventional" processes such as machining, casting, and injection molding, to the so-called "advanced machining" processes such as electrical discharge machining and abrasive waterjet machining, and to the vapor-phase processes used in semiconductor and nanomaterials fabrication. In all, 20 processes are analyzed. The results show that the intensity of materials and energy used per unit of mass of material processed (measured either as specific energy or exergy) has increased by at least 6 orders of magnitude over the past several decades. The increase of material/energy intensity use has been primarily a consequence of the introduction of new manufacturing processes, rather than changes in traditional technologies. This phenomenon has been driven by the desire for precise small-scale devices and product features and enabled by stable and declining material and energy prices over this period. We illustrate the relevance of thermodynamics (including exergy analysis) for all processes in spite of the fact that long-lasting focus in manufacturing has been on product quality--not necessarily energy/material conversion efficiency. We promote the use of thermodynamics tools for analysis of manufacturing processes within the context of rapidly increasing relevance of sustainable human enterprises. We confirm that exergy analysis can be used to identify where resources are lost in these processes, which is the first step in proposing and/or redesigning new more efficient processes.},

abstract = {3D printing of polymeric materials for various applications has been quickly developed in recent years. In contrast to thermoplastics, 3D printed thermosets, although desirable, are inherently non-recyclable due to their permanently crosslinked networks. As 3D printing is becoming more popular, it is desirable to develop recycling approaches for 3D printed parts in view of increasing polymer wastes. Here, we present a new thermosetting vitrimer epoxy ink and a 3D printing method that can 3D print epoxy into parts with complicated 3D geometries, which later can be recycled into a new ink for the next round of 3D printing. In the first printing cycle, a high-viscous ink is first slightly cured and is then printed at an elevated temperature into complicated 3D structures, followed by an oven cure using a two-step approach. To be recycled, the printed epoxy parts are fully dissolved in an ethylene glycol solvent in a sealed container at a high temperature. The dissolved polymer solution is reused for the next printing cycle using similar printing conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that the ink can be printed four times and still retains very good printability. In addition, the vitrimer epoxy can be used for pressure-free repairs for the 3D printed parts.},

The purpose of this study is to find proper utilization of these waste powders by developing filaments from these powders for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process. In order to develop filament materials, polyamide powders PA 12 (Nylon material) are mixed with various weight percentages (12.5, 25, 37.5 and 50) of tungsten carbide to enhance mechanical properties. To determine the suitability of powder mixtures for FDM, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Melt flow index (MFI) tests are performed. A single screw extruder is used to process these powder mixtures to form filaments for testing. It is found that the addition of tungsten carbide has increased glass transition temperature, MFI and the strength of resulting polyamide-tungsten carbide composites. Moreover, filaments possess comparable and better strength than existing filaments, which are used to successfully build 3D parts from an FDM system.},

A growing number of commentators criticize the approach, despite its success in triggering discussions about product design (longevity, reparability) and about options for sharing goods and services. The criticism centers on the mere technological fix orientation of the CE approach and its ecological modernist idea of gradually adapting the current production system to material resource constraints - while leaving aside socio-political aspects of consumption as well as the possible need for sufficiencyoriented lifestyles. This paper argues for a broader understanding of CE and for the use of an institutional perspective inspired through practice theory, and presents a framework to assess the transformative potential of CE, encompassing its alternative/dissenting articulations in the noncorporate sector.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that low-cost open-source 3-D printers can reduce costs by enabling distributed manufacturing of substitutes for both specialty equipment and conventional mass-manufactured products. The rate of 3-D printable designs under open licenses is growing exponentially and there are already hundreds of designs applicable to small-scale organic farming. It has also been hypothesized that this technology could assist sustainable development in rural communities that rely on small-scale organic agriculture. To gauge the present utility of open-source 3-D printers in this organic farm context both in the developed and developing world, this paper reviews the current open-source designs available and evaluates the ability of low-cost 3-D printers to be effective at reducing the economic costs of farming. This study limits the evaluation of open-source 3-D printers to only the most-developed fused filament fab-rication of the bioplastic polylactic acid (PLA). PLA is a strong biodegradable and recyclable thermoplastic appropriate for a range of representative products, which are grouped into five categories of prints: hand tools, food processing, animal management, water management and hydroponics. The advantages and shortcomings of applying 3-D printing to each technology are evaluated. The results show a generalizable technical viability and economic benefit to adopting open-source 3-D printing for any of the technologies, although the individual economic impact is highly dependent on needs and frequency of use on a specific farm. Capital costs of a 3-D printer may be saved from on-farm printing of a single advanced analytical instrument in a day or replacing hundreds of inexpensive products over a year. In order for the full potential of open-source 3-D printing to be realized to assist organic farm economic resiliency and self-sufficiency, future work is outlined in five core areas: designs of 3-D printable objects, 3-D printing materials, 3-D printers, software and 3-D printable repositories.},

Today, TRL assessments are used to make multimillion-dollar decisions at NASA and beyond, yet anecdotal evidence suggests that there are challenges associated with TRL use in practice. In this paper, we systematically uncover the practitioners' view, first via 19 interviews with employees from seven organizations. We identify 15 challenges of TRL implementations in three categories: system complexity, planning and review, and validity of assessment. Next, we prioritize these challenges via a survey of TRL practitioners, using a best-worst choice experiment. Finally, we identify best practices and proposed extensions to address the challenges. We find that system complexity challenges are most critical to TRL users, despite being addressed in the literature. We posit that addressing these opportunities could result in substantial improvements to decision processes and outcomes in complex engineering projects.},

This technology has tremendous potential to improve the quality and complexity of engineering products and also to raise the standard of life. Many big corporations and agencies are working to leverage this disruptive technology. This technology has not become as popular as the internet of things, etc. 3-D printing can help in sustainable operations via cost optimization, lead time reduction, safety incorporation, and better functionalities in the final products. The supply chain management of 3-D printed products is a must on digital platforms for the effective delivery of products and services of this evolving technology. No concrete study could be found that linked the supply chain management with the critical success factors of the 3-D printing industry. Hence this study was undertaken to understand the technical, economic, and managerial aspects that are critical for smooth operations of supply chains of 3-D printed products. This study is based on the literature review that includes various relevant articles available in the public domain regarding the supply chain of 3-D printed goods, 3-D printing industry reports, and research papers on Additive Manufacturing technology. The study concluded with the critical success factors for a customer-oriented supply chain of 3-D printed parts.

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques1 can produce complex, high-value metal parts, with potential applications as critical parts, such as those found in aerospace components. The production of AM parts with consistent and predictable properties requires input materials (e.g., metal powders) with known and repeatable characteristics, which in turn requires standardized measurement methods for powder properties. First, based on our previous work, we assess the applicability of current standardized methods for powder characterization for metal AM powders. Then we present the results of systematic studies carried out on two different powder materials used for additive manufacturing: stainless steel and cobalt-chrome. The characterization of these powders is important in NIST efforts to develop appropriate measurements and standards for additive materials and to document the property of powders used in a NIST-led additive manufacturing material round robin. An extensive array of characterization techniques was applied to these two powders, in both virgin and recycled states. The physical techniques included laser diffraction particle size analysis, X-ray computed tomography for size and shape analysis, and optical and scanning electron microscopy. Techniques sensitive to structure and chemistry, including X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive analytical X-ray analysis using the X-rays generated during scanning electron microscopy, and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy were also employed. The results of these analyses show how virgin powder changes after being exposed to and recycled from one or more Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) additive manufacturing build cycles. In addition, these findings can give insight into the actual additive manufacturing process.},

This approach combines the major manufacturing technologies including additive, formative and subtractive fabrication, as well as their parallel integration. A 6-axis robotic arm, repurposed as an integrated 3D printing, milling and sculpting platform, enables shifting between fabrication modes and across scales using different end effectors. Promoting an integrated approach to robotic fabrication, novel combination processes are demonstrated including 3D printing and milling fabrication composites. In addition, novel robotic fabrication processes are developed and evaluated, such as multi-axis plastic 3D printing, direct recycling 3D printing, and embedded printing. The benefits and limitations of the Compound Fabrication approach and its experimental platform are reviewed and discussed. Finally, contemplation regarding the future of multi-functional robotic fabrication is offered, in the context of the experiments reviewed and demonstrated in this paper. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Due to an increased pressure to be environmentally sustainable, many manufacturing organizations, especially from developing countries like Bangladesh, are attempting to make necessary changes in practices and supply chains. However, those attempts need to be applied strategically with the objective to be both environmentally sustainable and economically viable. This paper offers a decision-making methodology by integrating a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) for evaluating strategies for environmental sustainability based on their impact on the overall supply chain network of an organization. This paper first identifies 18 generic strategies for environmental sustainability and three supply chain performance measurement (PM) factors. Afterwards, the cause-effect relationships among these strategies and PM factors are utilized to capture the complicated relationships by FCM. The extended delta rule (EDR) learning algorithm was used in association with FCM to quantify the impact of those strategies on supply chain PM factors. Finally, DEA is used to prioritize strategies using these impact values. A real-life case using a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) manufacturer from Bangladesh is presented to justify the applicability of the proposed methodology.

abstract = {High-performance lightweight architectures, such as metallic microlattices with excellent mechanical properties have been 3D printed, but they do not possess shape memory effect (SME), limiting their usages for advanced engineering structures, such as serving as a core in multifunctional lightweight sandwich structures. 3D printable self-healing shape memory polymer (SMP) microlattices could be a solution. However, existing 3D printable thermoset SMPs are limited to either low strength, poor stress memory, or non-recyclability. To address this issue, a new thermoset polymer, integrated with high strength, high recovery stress, perfect shape recovery, good recyclability, and 3D printability using direct light printing, has been developed in this study. Lightweight microlattices with various unit cells and length scales were printed and tested. The results show that the cubic microlattice has mechanical strength comparable to or even greater than that of metallic microlattices, good SME, decent recovery stress, and recyclability, making it the first multifunctional lightweight architecture (MLA) for potential multifunctional lightweight load carrying structural applications.},

abstract = {Polymers are the most versatile material in our modern day and age. With certain chemicals and additives (pigments, concentrates, anti-blockers, light transformers (LTs), UV-stabilizers, etc.), they become what we know as plastics. The aim of this review is to provide the reader with an in depth analysis regarding the recovery, treatment and recycling routes of plastic solid waste (PSW), as well as the main advantages and disadvantages associated with every route. Recovery and recycling of PSW can be categorized by four main routes, i.e. re-extrusion, mechanical, chemical and energy recovery. Re-extrusion (primary recycling) utilizes scrap plastics by re-introducing the reminder of certain extruded thermoplastics (mainly poly-??-olefins) into heat cycles within a processing line. When plastic articles are discarded after a number of life cycles, mechanical recycling techniques present themselves as a candidate for utilizing a percentage of the waste as recyclate and/or fillers. Collectively, all technologies that convert polymers to either monomers (monomer recycling) or petrochemicals (feedstock recycling) are referred to as chemical recycling. The technology behind its success is the depolymerization processes (e.g. thermolysis) that can result in a very profitable and sustainable industrial scheme, providing a high product yield and a minimal waste. Nevertheless, due to their high calorific value and embodied energy, plastics are being incinerated solely or in combination with municipal solid waste (MSW) in many developed countries. This review also presents a number of application and technologies currently being used to incinerate plastics. Cement kilns and fluidized beds are the two most common units used to recover energy from PSW or MSW with high PSW content. It is concluded that, tertiary (chemical methods) and quaternary (energy recovery) are robust enough to be investigated and researched in the near future, for they provide a very sustainable solution to the PSW cycle. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this article, we use Hirsch and Levin's notion of umbrella concepts as an analytical lens, in order to articulate the valuable catalytic function the circular economy (CE) concept could perform in the waste and resource management debate. We realize this goal by anchoring the CE concept in this broader debate through a narrative approach. This leads to the insight that whereas the various resource strategies grouped under the CE's banner are not new individually, the concept offers a new framing of these strategies by drawing attention to their capacity of prolonging resource use as well as to the relationship between these strategies. As such, the CE offers a new perspective on waste and resource management and provides a new cognitive unit and discursive space for debate. We conclude by discussing research opportunities for the industrial ecology (IE) community relating to the concept's theoretical development and its implementation. Specifically, we pose that reinvigorating and growing the social science aspects of IE is required for both. After all, it is in understanding and facilitating the collective implementation of any idea, also the CE concept, that the potential lies for shaping our material future.},

abstract = {Most of post-consumer plastic toys are being ended up as waste. The waste plastic toys can pose a great risk to both people and the environment; at the same time, we will lose many valuable materials that could be recycled. The aim of the present study was to explore the possibility of producing high quality products from waste plastic toys whilst enabling waste plastics to retain their original colour profile. First, the recyclability of the waste plastic toys was investigated using a single screw extruder. The physical, chemical and mechanical properties of prepared filaments were evaluated. Repeated thermo-mechanical stresses did not alter the properties of polymers significantly until ten reprocessing cycles, which suggests that waste plastic toys can be recycled at the end of their lives. Then, the filaments produced from both waste plastic toys and virgin polymer served to fabricate products using a three-dimensional (3D) printer, to examine the possibility of producing high quality products using new manufacturing techniques. The tensile strength, elastic modulus and impact strength of the printed product were found to be 32 ± 2 MPa, 2253 ± 271 MPa and 40 ± 1 kJ/m2, respectively. The mechanical properties of the 3D printed specimens from waste plastics were as good as virgin material. The process developed in this study can reduce carbon footprint and production cost. The utilisation of waste plastic toys as feedstock to produce new plastic products is not only an environment-friendly option but also profitable.},

abstract = {3D printing functional parts with known mechanical properties is challenging using variable open source 3D printers. This study investigates the mechanical properties of 3D printed parts using a commercial open-source 3D printer for a wide range of materials. The samples are tested for tensile strength following ASTM D638. The results are presented and conclusions are drawn about the mechanical properties of various fused filament fabrication materials. The study demonstrates that the tensile strength of a 3D printed specimen depends largely on the mass of the specimen, for all materials. Thus, to solve the challenge of unknown print quality on mechanical properties of a 3D printed part a two step process is proposed, which has a reasonably high expectation that a part will have tensile strengths described in this study for a given material. First, the exterior of the print is inspected visually for sub-optimal layers. Then, to determine if there has been under-extrusion in the interior, the mass of the sample is measured. This mass is compared to the theoretical value using densities for the material and the volume of the object. This two step process provides a means to assist low-cost open-source 3D printers expand the range of object production to functional parts.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature Materials informatics employs techniques, tools, and theories drawn from the emerging fields of data science, internet, computer science and engineering, and digital technologies to the materials science and engineering to accelerate materials, products and manufacturing innovations. Manufacturing is transforming into shorter design cycles, mass customization, on-demand production, and sustainable products. Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is a popular example of such a trend. However, the success of this manufacturing transformation is critically dependent on the availability of suitable materials and of data on invertible processing–structure–property–performance life cycle linkages of materials. Experience suggests that the material development cycle, i.e. the time to develop and deploy new material, generally exceeds the product design and development cycle. Hence, there is a need to accelerate materials innovation in order to keep up with product and manufacturing innovations. This is a major challenge considering the hundreds of thousands of materials and processes, and the huge amount of data on microstructure, composition, properties, and functional, environmental, and economic performance of materials. Moreover, the data sharing culture among the materials community is sparse. Materials informatics is key to the necessary transformation in product design and manufacturing. Through the association of material and information sciences, the emerging field of materials informatics proposes to computationally mine and analyze large ensembles of experimental and modeling datasets efficiently and cost effectively and to deliver core materials knowledge in user-friendly ways to the designers of materials and products, and to the manufacturers. This paper reviews the various developments in materials informatics and how it facilitates materials innovation by way of specific examples.},

abstract = {It is argued in general that future success in effective innovation creation is built on the ability to connect and manage talent, partnerships and related practical innovation processes. This makes it challenging for a university to develop an ecosystem of knowledge creation. The full benefit from a university can only be obtained if the university and society are organically linked together. The needs of society have to be at the centre of a university's activities, and flexible adjustment to changing needs is necessary but often lacking. Campus management has a major role in the facilitation of multidisciplinary interaction between students, scientists, entrepreneurs and other industry partners that inspire each other with different perspectives on the same subject. One significant tool to support open innovation with diverse stakeholders is to provide supportive spaces with relevant services. This paper aims to identify the requirements of a Co-creation Centre as a concept serving the third role of auniversity. The literature review was conducted and, based on the result, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for capturing the key requirements for developing a multiuser Co-creation Centre. The framework consists ofthe requirements on the demand and supply sides of campus management. The main findings in this paper are that different modes of knowledge conversion have different capabilities tosupport knowledge co-creation requirements. Knowledge co-creation process requirements in the multiuser Co-creation Centre for university–industry collaboration are best supported by originating “Ba”, which means the place where individuals share feelings, emotions, experiences, and mental models and the place where the knowledge-creation process begins. The results contribute to the concept development in campus management and provide a starting point for evaluating the success of multidisciplinary and multi-actor innovation environments.},

In this report we demonstrate how to fabricate soft prostheses mold with a low cost desktop 3D printer. The fabrication method used is referred to as Scanning Printing Polishing Casting (SPPC). Firstly the anatomy is scanned with a 3Dscanner, then a tissue casting mold is designed on computer and printed with a desktop 3D printer. Subsequently, a chemical polishing method is used to polish the casting mold by removing the staircase effect and acquiring a smooth surface. Finally, the last step is to cast medical grade silicone into the mold. After the silicone is cured, the fine soft prostheses can be removed from the mold. Utilizing the SPPC method, soft prostheses with smooth surface and complicated structure can be fabricated at a low cost. Accordingly, the total cost of fabricating ear prosthesis is about {\$}30, which is much lower than the current soft prostheses fabrication methods},

Moreover, with the expansion of online-offline convergence, cities can grow without limitation on its size, where connectivity and innovation determine the inclination of the city's benefit-cost curve. As a city platform is responsible for connectivity, its value drastically increases through the 4th Industrial Revolution's O2O (online to offline convergence) platform. When a city reflects on its own as a Digital Twin in the Cloud and when complete information becomes accessible through citizen's participation through smartphones (Edge), Self-organization takes place, an ideal linkage between the city and citizens.

Accordingly, a variety of policy initiatives are aimed at promoting the establishment, growth and impact of innovative start-ups. Designing such policies is a challenging task, because most start-ups fail. In addition, only a small share of those start-ups will ultimately prove to be innovative, and very few of those will eventually become high impact firms. Hence, effective policies require a better understanding of the processes by which innovative start-ups are formed, developed and create impact, as well as of the heterogeneous nature inherent to innovative start-ups along with their development trajectory. This article reviews 39 policy initiatives from around the world and classifies their approaches to the phenomenon of innovative start-ups. By relying on insights from the papers mentioned in this special issue, we develop a process framework by elaborating on (i) the antecedents of the creation of innovative start-ups, (ii) their founding characteristics, (iii) their behavior, and finally (iv) the outputs and impacts generated by them. Our framework highlights how policy initiatives, managerial issues and research approaches are conceptually different, depending on the specific stage of firm development. We conclude with implications for policy initiatives and further research.},

The initial coarse-grained structure (25 $\mu$m) in the material changed into fine dynamically recrystallized grains (0.3-10 $\mu$m) at the foil interface within the order of a few milliseconds of processing. This phenomenon led to metallurgical bonding through grain boundary migration and allowed for successive welding of tapes to form a three-dimensional part. {\textcopyright} 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {Sample collection procedures and primary receptacle (sample container and bag) decontamination methods should prevent contaminant transfer between contaminated and non-contaminated surfaces and areas during bio-incident operations. Cross-contamination of personnel, equipment, or sample containers may result in the exfiltration of biological agent from the exclusion (hot) zone and have unintended negative consequences on response resources, activities and outcomes. The current study was designed to: (1) evaluate currently recommended sample collection and packaging procedures to identify procedural steps that may increase the likelihood of spore exfiltration or contaminant transfer; (2) evaluate the efficacy of currently recommended primary receptacle decontamination procedures; and (3) evaluate the efficacy of outer packaging decontamination methods. Wet- and dry-deposited fluorescent tracer powder was used in contaminant transfer tests to qualitatively evaluate the currently-recommended sample collection procedures. Bacillus atrophaeus spores, a surrogate for Bacillus anthracis, were used to evaluate the efficacy of spray- and wipe-based decontamination procedures. Both decontamination procedures were quantitatively evaluated on three types of sample packaging materials (corrugated fiberboard, polystyrene foam, and polyethylene plastic), and two contamination mechanisms (wet or dry inoculums). Contaminant transfer results suggested that size-appropriate gloves should be worn by personnel, templates should not be taped to or removed from surfaces, and primary receptacles should be selected carefully. The decontamination tests indicated that wipe-based decontamination procedures may be more effective than spray-based procedures; efficacy was not influenced by material type but was affected by the inoculation method. Incomplete surface decontamination was observed in all tests with dry inoculums. This study provides a foundation for optimizing current B. anthracis response procedures to minimize contaminant exfiltration.},

In this paper we reflect on the implications of this new innovation context for traditional product development processes. Given these implications, two challenges are discussed that are crucial to true user-driven innovation, i.e. the challenge of continuously involving the user and the need for tools to facilitate the integration of knowledge into the increasingly interdisciplinary development process. Drawing on our own experiences in the interdisciplinary Research On Mobile Applications and Services (ROMAS) project, which focused on future mobile applications in a living lab setting, we illustrate how the two challenges can be tackled.},

abstract = {Fabrication spaces (Fab-spaces) provide individuals with access to numerous manufacturing equipment (including additive manufacturing), to carry out different types of projects. Although scholars are starting to speculate about the importance of these new organisational forms and their potential for future distributed innovation and production ecologies, this phenomenon is still largely unexplored. Building on existing multidisciplinary research, this paper offers the first empirical analysis of existing fab-spaces as providers of knowledge and production competencies. Amongst all the possible perspectives to derive a framework, we choose that of fab-space users who have an entrepreneurial intention. After deriving an analytical framework to position fab-spaces in the current academic discourse, the paper develops a classification, which considers the competences available to entrepreneurs, via fab-spaces, in conjunction with how these competences are provided. The resulting map reveals the complementarities amongst the different fab-spaces. It also shows that the current portfolio of fab-spaces supports mainly the distribution of innovation across locations and social groups. Several types of fab-spaces are currently well placed to support the transition from innovation to manufacturing, but their geographical distribution and range of manufacturing capabilities are not yet enough to provide a fully distributed manufacturing model. This study has practical consequences for entrepreneurs, in the better identification of the appropriate fab-spaces for their needs, and for policy-makers, to help position the different types of fab-spaces as elements for national systems of innovation and production.},

Five general claims emerged across our analyses of 69 empirical studies published in refereed journals or books in English from 1993 to 2013. Each claim has firm empirical support but each also warrants further research and refinement: (1) students experience difficulties with, but develop certain strategies to deal with, the complex processes of writing from sources; (2) prior knowledge and experience influence students' performance in writing from sources; (3) differences may appear between L1 and L2 students in their understanding and uses of sources in writing; (4) performance in tasks that involve writing from sources varies by task conditions and types of texts written and read; and (5) instruction can help students improve their uses of sources in their writing.},

This paper reports on a multiple case study of 21 demonstration projects in the area of sustainable technology set in Sweden and offers two contributions. First, it maps the project-internal and external factors that allow or prohibit demonstration projects to reach their goals. Second, it suggests a process model outlining the key activities for setting up a new demonstration project. By doing so, the paper provides important implications for the process of developing and commercializing sustainable technologies. The escalating environmental crisis in particular underscores the need for new knowledge about how cleaner and more sustainable technologies can be applied.},

abstract = {The increasing usage of polymeric materials and the greater range of requirements in product design lead to the combined use of more than one material in the same product, component, the so-called multi-material products. These products represent a risk for the environment, as they make the conventional recycling process more complicated. The main problem in recycling polymeric multi-material products is related to the difficulty in separating their components. Thus, it is necessary to find solutions to allow multi-material recycling without the need to separate these materials. In this context, this study aimed to analyze the technical feasibility for the application of micronization in recycling polymeric multi-material products and to evaluate the potential of the resulting materials for use in new products. Therefore, a theoretical part, focusing on polymeric multi-material products and micronization, and a practical study, consisting of multi-material toothbrushes recycled via micronization, were presented. The experimental investigation involved the micronization of multi-material toothbrushes, followed by extrusion and injection molding. Subsequently, the resulting material was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), tensile strength test and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The results showed that micronization is a potential process to promote the recycling of multi-material products, and there was no degradation during the process. The recycled micronized material had a low level of interaction with the LLDPE matrix, which affected the elongation at break, causing loss of ductility and tenacity compared to virgin LLDPE. However, it did not affect the tensile strength, which presented an increase of 18.43{\%} compared to the reference. Despite better performance in tensile strength, the recycled sample showed an intense decrease in the storage modulus in temperatures above 30 °C. This may limit the use of these materials in certain products. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that the resulting material has potential applications in new products.},

In the Pack-alone scenario, similar emotional spaces and sample configurations were obtained with both images and words. In the Pack-and-tasting scenario, the richness of the emotional response increased when using images. In both scenarios, the participants used a greater number of negative emotions when these were presented as images rather than as words. This could be considered an advantage, as it enables some negative emotional loads to be portrayed.

The study used a structural equation modelling approach to verify the environmental consciousness model and hierarchical agglomeration method for segmentation. It was based on secondary data on environmental issues gathered in 28 EU member states. Personal attitudinal dimensions in the model explained a relatively high proportion of the variance in sustainable behaviour. The segmentation analysis yielded three distinct segments that differ in their environmental consciousness and are affiliated with different EU country clusters.

This model builds on the conjunction of the digital commons of knowledge and design with desktop and benchtop manufacturing technologies (from three-dimensional printers and laser cutters to low-tech tools and crafts). Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a “design global, manufacture local” model, as exemplified by these case studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production. “Design global, manufacture local” may be seen as a platform to bridge digital and knowledge commons with existing physical infrastructures and degrowth communities, in order to achieve distributed modes of collaborative production.},

This study critically examines how open source 3-D printers, such as the RepRap and Fab@home, enable the use of designs in the public domain to fabricate open source appropriate technology (OSAT), which are easily and economically made from readily available resources by local communities to meet their needs. The current capabilities of open source 3-D printers is reviewed and a new classification scheme is proposed for OSATs that are technically feasible and economically viable for production. Then, a methodology for quantifying the properties of printed parts and a research trajectory is outlined to extend the existing technology to provide complete village-level fabrication of OSATs. Finally, conclusions are drawn on the potential for open source 3-D printers to assist in driving sustainable development.},

Conclusions:
Open source 3D printing is currently in the hacker/development stage and does not have reliability nor the testing and verification needed to deploy in the field in developing countries.


Different research trajectories are outlined to improve local feedstock, size of the parts, material properties and the use of renewable energies.},

abstract = {In today's complex and changing business environment the concern with sustainability has gained more notoriety. However, companies still do not have a sustainable perspective, but a short-term one, where their values are constantly forgotten and this concept is no longer welcomed. This research demonstrates the need for companies to adapt and to start acting in this direction. Following a set of interviews conducted with professionals with management positions of high responsibility, findings reveal that although sustainability is on the management mind, strategies and tools need to be adapted to be at the core of the organization's strategic formulation. To support this process, a new SWOT analysis to fit a forward-looking sustainable world is proposed. Furthermore, due to the aggregative nature of the model, it represents an essential tool for an open innovation. “SWOT i” integrates the concern with sustainability as one of its pillars, placing the values and impacts that each decision can have at the center of the strategic formulation, allowing their performance to leverage.},

This paper holds that the theoretical apparatus and concepts belonging to the industrial phase of capitalism largely fall short with respect to the repercussions that intellectual property rights regime yields. Embracing the methodological precept that social theory must be moulded in order to address the contours of contemporary social reality, this paper engages in an autonomist Marxist update on the concept of intellectual property rights. It ultimately challenges the “intellectual property rights are a socio-economic need” thesis and speculatively argues that the current system of intellectual property rights, directed politically towards the enclosure of commons, constitutes a structural contradiction by i) forming a basis for a social crisis in terms of the established relations of production, and ii) curtailing a part of the socio-economic opportunities for innovation, profit-making, and growth.},

abstract = {The widespread use of plastics in the conditioning, packaging and building material sectors generates an enormous amount of industrial waste which could be recycled for wastewater pipes and fittings. Nevertheless, current manufacturing standards in the piping industry recommend against the use of post-consumer recycled materials - a policy based on inadequate understanding of the properties and long-term mechanical performance of recycled materials. The present study compared the material characteristics of virgin and recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastics commonly found in the piping industry. Mechanical testing, oxidative induction time (OIT), melt flow index (MFI) and thermal analysis were used in conjunction with X-ray fluorescence (??-XRF), size exclusion chromatography and {\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C solid-state NMR to evaluate mechanical behavior and molecular structure as well as contaminant or filler contents. This study provides evidence for the degradation processes impact that can occur when post-industrial and post-consumer polymers are recycled. However, the study identified two measures to improve the material qualities of post-consumer recycled HDPE: 1) reducing the amount of contaminants or, alternatively, improving their compatibility with HDPE resins, and 2) improving current sorting and recycling processes to increase the amount of tie molecules in HDPE materials.},

abstract = {Literature reviews are a genre that many graduate students do not fully understand and find difficult to write. While the genre, language and rhetorical moves of literature reviews are widely researched, less research focuses on citation use in literature reviews. Teaching students ‘how-to' write the literature review through explicit genre awareness is not enough. What is needed, is a focus on the discursive nature of citations since citations are a core ingredient in literature reviews. The complexity of citing, referencing and using sources is difficult to teach in university classrooms, especially in courses that focus on content knowledge. When it is taught, it is often imparted to students as conventions with particular organisational features around citation styles. Or it is taught within the discourse of morality and academic dishonesty that surrounds plagiarism. What is lacking is a pedagogy that relates citing to the more complex discursive practices that are implicit and deeply embedded in particular time-bound contexts. The purpose of this research was to explore citation patterns in 23 draft and final masters' student literature review papers to better understand the ways in which students use sources in literature reviews with the aim of informing pedagogy. Findings indicate that the concept of intertextuality, specifically, transgressive intertextuality, intertextual engagement and discursive intertextuality can help with the teaching and learning of literature reviews and citation use.},

The scenario planning process can help deal with uncertainties in an increasingly dynamic environment, particularly if they are perceived as plausible. To explore the practicalities of developing plausible scenarios we utilised a case study, and involved key stakeholders, to investigate the ‘Future of Work' in Dunedin, Aotearoa, New Zealand. Using sensemaking analysis we show how participants utilized their individual frames of reference to interpret how plausible the scenarios were, while also constructing cues to prospectively ‘make sense'. Therefore, we contribute both to understanding how to build plausibility into scenario planning and how participants make sense of future scenarios. We propose a model, based on the sensemaking concepts of frames and cues, that supports the construction of plausible scenarios. We conclude that designing plausible scenarios, as a prospective sensemaking device, is a powerful way to encourage discussion about futures and to understand the consequences of today's activities on tomorrow's realities. Understanding how to design scenarios that are perceived as plausible from a stakeholder's perspective is crucial for building understandings of future events.},

abstract = {A quantitative measure of performance that integrates national-level carbon emission profiles with key parameters of social and economic wellbeing can provide an effective management tool for policy interventions. This paper constructs non-parametric evaluation and decomposition models using hybrid measure and meta-frontier techniques. The proposed models are employed to estimate the wellbeing performance of carbon emissions (WPCE) and identify the sources of WPCE inefficiency. Empirical analyses based on the Group 20 (G20) countries for the 2000–2015 period shows the worst performance is in the BRICS country group (i.e. Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) – known for rapid growth – whereas the developed and the developing economies of the G20 group show positive trajectories of performance. As for China, its performance measure of WPCE was the lowest among the G20 indicating significant potential for further improvement. The analysis also highlights the role of managerial failure as the primary driver of inefficiency, more important than technological inefficiency in explaining efficiency loss within the G20 countries. This critical finding – the relevance and importance of managerial capability – suggests the need for a high level of attention to governance and managerial capacity to ensure continued improvements in performance on carbon emissions and human wellbeing. A lesson to be drawn from this study is that China's policies to promote a low carbon economy can benefit from increased priority given to low-carbon technological innovation for the energy system transition and enhancement of environmental governance and managerial capacity to achieve a long-term sustainability.},

abstract = {The technology readiness level (TRL) scale was introduced by NASA in the 1970s as a tool for assessing the maturity of technologies during complex system development. TRL data have been used to make multi-million dollar technology management decisions in programs such as NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover. This scale is now a de facto standard used for technology assessment and oversight in many industries, from power systems to consumer electronics. Low TRLs have been associated with significantly reduced timeliness and increased costs across a portfolio of US Department of Defense programs. However, anecdotal evidence raises concerns about many of the practices related to TRLs. We study TRL implementations based on semi-structured interviews with employees from seven different organizations and examine documentation collected from industry standards and organizational guidelines related to technology development and demonstration. Our findings consist of 15 challenges observed in TRL implementations that fall into three different categories: system complexity, planning and review, and validity of assessment. We explore research opportunities for these challenges and posit that addressing these opportunities, either singly or in groups, could improve decision processes and performance outcomes in complex engineering projects.},

abstract = {Manufacturing in areas of the developing world that lack electricity severely restricts the technical sophistication of what is produced. More than a billion people with no access to electricity still have access to some imported higher-technologies; however, these often lack customization and often appropriateness for their community. Open source appropriate technology (OSAT) can over- come this challenge, but one of the key impediments to the more rapid development and distri- bution of OSAT is the lack of means of production beyond a specific technical complexity. This study designs and demonstrates the technical viability of two open-source mobile digital manufacturing facilities powered with solar photovoltaics, and capable of printing customizable OSAT in any com- munity with access to sunlight. The first, designed for community use, such as in schools or maker- spaces, is semi-mobile and capable of nearly continuous 3-D printing using RepRap technology, while also powering multiple computers. The second design, which can be completely packed into a standard suitcase, allows for specialist travel from community to community to provide the ability to custom manufacture OSAT as needed, anywhere. These designs not only bring the possibility of complex manufacturing and replacement part fabrication to isolated rural communities lacking access to the electric grid, but they also offer the opportunity to leap-frog the entire conventional manufacturing supply chain, while radically reducing both the cost and the environmental impact of products for developing communities},

abstract = {A promising method of enhancing the circular economy is distributed plastic recycling. In this study plastic waste is upcycled into 3-D printing filament with a recyclebot, which is an open source waste plastic extruder. The recyclebot is combined with an open source self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer, to enable post-consumer ABS plastic filament from computer waste to be further upcycled into valuable consumer products pre-designed in the digital commons. The total electrical energy consumption for the combined process is monitored and an economic evaluation is completed. The coupled distributed recycling and manufacturing method for complex products reduces embodied energy by half, while reducing the cost of consumer products to pennies. This economic benefit provides an incentive for consumers to both home recycle and home manufacture, which tightens the loop on the circular economy by eliminating waste associated from transportation and retail. It is clear from the results that waste plastic can be significantly upcycled at the individual level using this commons-based approach. This tightening of the loop of the circular economy benefits the environment and sustainability as well as the economic stability of consumers/prosumers.},

abstract = {The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are an interconnected strategy for the promotion of sustainable practices and solutions that addresses the main issues faced by our society. Concomitantly, two emerging topics are currently gaining interest due to their potential to implement systematic shifts and contribute to achieving the SDG-Circular Economy (CE) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0). This research performed a systematic literature review to identify how the CE-I4.0 nexus, the combination of CE practices and I4.0 technologies, could contribute to achieving the SDG. A total of 50 peer-review articles that addressed the simultaneous or individual link between CE and I4.0 to sustainability form the review portfolio. The articles were first screened with regard to the I4.0 technologies and CE practices applied, and further analyzed in order to understand the stronger links to the SDG. Findings show that the CE-I4.0 nexus directly benefits SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12, and SDG 13. The specific targets addressed by the combined implementation of CE practices and I4.0 technologies are disclosed and discussed. We argue that the CE-I4.0 nexus is pivotal in the endeavors to reach the SDG, as it connects innovative technologies with novel circular production and business models, which ultimately brings the opportunity to tackle the SDG targets intensified in this study. Further research could quantitatively address the impacts of the CE-I4.0 nexus, investigate secondary effects on the SDG, or develop further case studies under the CE-I4.0 umbrella.},

We engaged in a three-fold research endeavour to address these questions. Firstly, we conducted an in-depth literature review, mapping the emergence and developments of the circular economy concept in time and space with a specific focus on urban studies. Secondly, we analysed documented translations of the circular economy imaginary in three European metropolitan cities (Amsterdam, Paris and London)to explore the discourses, institutions, representations and social identities underpinning their respective translations, and reflect on how they diverge from each other and how they have the potential to deliver sustainable outcomes. Thirdly, these results were used to outline a research agenda that explores the relationship between the political and the epistemic domain of existing urban translations of circular economy across scales and places, to support future empirical investigations of whether and how circular economy imaginaries can support transformative pathways for socially inclusive and environmentally desirable value creation in cities. In so doing, this paper fosters reflexivity for both theory and practice in order to better understand how theorisations and the application of circular economy could be advanced in support of urban sustainability transitions.},

abstract = {The aim of the article is to explore the possible impacts of culture on in-country regional differences in innovation capacities and propensity to entrepreneurship using the Hofstede's model of national culture. There is a number of studies that proved the profound influence of culture on innovation and entrepreneurship capacities. By contrast to cross-country cultural studies, the cross-regional cultural research on innovation and entrepreneurship within a country, especially in Europe, is an under-researched area. The research is based on national survey data (N = 1000) in Croatia, the country that suffers from weaknesses in innovation and entrepreneurial capacities with great regional development disparities. This suggests it as a good example for exploring regional cultural differences. The research proved that Croatian regions are culturally heterogonous but the correlation between regional culture and regional entrepreneurship and innovation capacities was not found. Hofstede's model appeared as having little practical value for strategic management and development and suggest that other factors, presumably more structural than cultural, that mediate poor innovation and entrepreneurship performance should be taken into account. The article contributed to the conceptualization and empirical research of regional innovation culture and provide evidence of the limited explanatory power of Hofstede's model in explaining regional differences by cultural factors.},

In the EU urban land and forests increased while cropland, grassland and heathland decreased. Other ecosystem types underwent smaller changes. The main trends in provisioning, regulating and maintenance, and cultural ecosystem services were assessed using a set of 30 indicators assorted according to the CICES classification. More crops for food, feed and energy were produced in the EU on less arable land. More organic food was grown. Textile crop production and the total number of grazing livestock decreased. Water use relative to water availability remained stable. Timber removals increased but so, too, did the total timber stock. There was an increase in net ecosystem productivity (growing biomass). Several regulating services, but in particular those which are related to the presence of trees, woodland or forests, increased slightly. This was the case for water retention, forest carbon potential, erosion control, and air quality regulation. Pollination potential and habitat quality showed a negative trend. There was a positive trend in the opportunity for citizens to have access to land with a high recreation potential.},

The methodology aims to improve the algorithmic thinking in the students due to the deficiencies detected in it, as well as, it searches that the students learn a second programming language, using hands-on designs and activities that require the components mentioned. In addition, the methodology has been employed into the curriculum of a course of programming known as (open hardware) for students of technology in electronics (n = 22), observing that the students learn programming concepts in a better way and their motivation and engagement towards the software area was increased during the course. To technical level, the methodology uses the programming language Python in order to interact with the different ports, peripherals and utilities of the platforms mentioned, creating a link between these elements and the aspects concerning the software design, e.g., data types, classes, methods or Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Finally, the methodology takes into account two important aspects, firstly, the skills developed by the students in the proposal are involved into the BoK (Body of Knowledge) of different engineering areas as embedded systems, control and computer science and, secondly, programming is perhaps one of the most difficult areas in engineering but in turn, it has a ubiquitous nature in the areas mentioned.},

This paper therefore develops a critical-historicizing perspective that highlights the social construction of innovations in social relations. Building on scholarship in Strategic Niche Management, grassroots innovation and critical innovation studies, four ‘shapes of social innovation' are distinguished. Substantiating and deepening this conceptual classification through empirical evidence on 20 SI initiatives, the analysis highlights how social innovations may take on several of the theorised appearances throughout their existence in society (shapeshifting). Disclosing overlooked SI phenomena, this critical-historicizing understanding informs more comprehensive and balanced SI research and practice.},

abstract = {Nature is an information sourcebook of behaviour, function, colour and shape which can inspire visual design and invention. Studying the form and functional characteristics of a natural object can provide inspiration for product design and help to improve the marketability of manufactured products. The inspiration can be triggered either by direct observation or captured by three-dimensional (3D) digitising techniques to obtain superficial information (geometry and colour). An art designer often creates a concept in the form of a two-dimensional (2D) sketch while engineering methods lead to a point cloud in 3D. Each has its limitations in that the art designer commonly lacks the knowledge to build a final product from a 2D sketch and the engineering designer's 3D point clouds may not be very beautiful. We propose a method for Product Design from Nature (PDN), coupling aesthetic intent and geometrical characteristics, exploring the interactions between designers and nature's systems in PDN. We believe that this approach would considerably reduce the lead time and cost of product design from nature. {\textcopyright} 2008 Jilin University.},

abstract = {It is a consensus that we are passing by a period of severe natural resource depletion. Our current linear socioeconomic system, characterized by the product discard at the end of product life, is one of the main causes of this natural depletion. Some governs and institution, as European Union [3] and The Ellen MacArthur Foundation [1], are calling for a new economic model, as can be seen on the Europe 2020 strategy [4]: "the Europe Union has no choice but to go for the transition to a resource-efficient and ultimately regenerative circular economy". This highlights the trend for a circular economy, characterized by restoration and circularity of product components. It is a response to the inefficient management of the resources in the traditional linear model. To support this transition from a linear to a circular economy, business managers rely on new business models be developed. Product-Service System (PSS) is considered a business model that integrates products and services with the aim of fulfilling customer's needs. The objective of this study is to identify if PSS can be used as a business model for firms achieve resource-efficiency through circular economy. This study constitute a literature review and a bibliometric analysis about PSS and circular economy.},

abstract = {Social entrepreneurship has been recognized as an innovative and effective approach to poverty reduction and employment generation. However, the roles undertaken by social enterprises in Malaysia and Singapore are still limited and many are grappling to survive. Determine the external resources that could increase social enterprises' efficiencies and performance, are the key management issues for the external supportive bodies. Guiding by the resource dependence theory, this cross-nation quantitative study established a framework to examine the most prominent external resources (i.e., financial and training supports), which were mediated by formal business planning, towards the financial and social performance of social enterprises in the emerging contexts (i.e., Malaysia and Singapore). The empirical data on 181 Malaysian and Singaporean social enterprises were analysed by using a structural equation modelling approach. The research findings reveal that financial and training supports should be correlated closely with formal business planning in order to generate a significant impact on their organisational performance. The results showed business planning plays a dominant role between the external supports and social enterprises' performance. This challenges the conventional knowledge that common business practices of profit-driven companies are not suitable for mission-driven organisations. The moderation effects of the socio-economic context were found to be insignificant. The research model's predictive power and predictive capability for all the endogenous constructs were satisfied and assured. Furthermore, the Importance-Performance Map Analysis corresponded with the path coefficient results, the main factor to enhance social enterprises' performance is through the improvement in business planning practices, and financial support is another area to enhance their social performance.},

abstract = {This study concerns the evaluation of several properties/characteristics of 3D printed poly(lactic acid) (PLA) polymer and acrylonitrile–butadienestyrene (ABS) copolymer, recycled from food packages and car dashboards, respectively. The aim is to evaluate the potential of recycled polymers that are recovered from solid polymer waste (SPW) to be reused for functional components/parts for add-value applications. The study compared the performance of the recycled material with the obtained from the 3D printing of virgin polymer. The characterization was made considering the chemical, thermal and mechanical properties as well as surface roughness and wettability. Although the thermal characterization did not indicate significant variations between recycled and virgin material, the mechanical recycling process induced some chain scission in PLA. Consequently, the semi-crystalline polymer revealed losses of 33{\%} both in tensile stress and flexural strength. On the contrary, recycled ABS did not show changes in the mechanical properties of the printed specimens. Both recycled polymers produced smoother surfaces with a decrease of the mean surface roughness between 55{\%} and 65{\%}. Considering the properties required by manufacturers of food containers and car dashboards, this study indicates that recycled materials can be reused for the same applications.},

abstract = {An increase in the number of companies that publish corporate social responsibility (CSR) statements, and a rise in their ‘sustainability' research, reflects a growing acceptance that broad ethical considerations are key for any type of company. However, little is known about how companies consider moral objectives for their research and development (R{\&}D) activities, or the basis upon which these activities are chosen. This research involves qualitative investigation into Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry, comprising 30 in-depth, pan-European interviews with key personnel in the industry, and focus groups with employees at 14 different companies. Through investigation of the ‘responsible' activities these companies currently undertake, we shed light on the types of moral goals they set and their underlying ethical standpoints. By reviewing both the responsible innovation and sustainability discourses, and presenting phenomenological evidence, we demonstrate that companies have adopted some aspects of RRI, even though it might not be recognised as such. Our findings indicate that these innovators recognise some of the ethical and societal concerns associated with their activities but their approach is often piecemeal; primary focus is upon the most immediate issues and on legal compliance, to the detriment of broader societal issues and wider challenges. We recommend explicit mechanisms that draw upon established ethical thought and practical academic work to improve companies' abilities to carry out their sustainability activities, and incorporate them into a responsible business strategy. We conclude with recommendations for innovators, corporate research and development, and policy.},

abstract = {In informal urban settlements, there is an abundance of plastic waste material, which creates a range of health and environment-related problems. At the same time, there is a lack of locally produced products to improve the conditions for basic needs such as water and hygiene. As a means to connect these two challenges, we propose a distinctive solution in this paper: Do-it-Yourself (DIY) workspaces run by local entrepreneurs that transform plastic waste into valuable water and sanitation products. Our focus area during this project was the Korail slum in Dhaka. With the support of the Capability Driven Design (CDD) method, that AIDS design teams to systematically and comprehensively explore user contexts, we conducted an intensive field study in Korail. These insights helped us to identify fifteen product ideas, which were assessed on a range of criteria for viability. One of the worked-out solutions is a lid with vibrant colors made of recycled plastics to cover the aluminum pots used for storing water. Consequently, a lid and corresponding mould for local use with the plastic recycling machines of Precious Plastics were developed. The team also developed a business plan that is embedded in the network structure of the community and can be adopted by local entrepreneurs. The uniqueness of our approach lies in valorizing the use of local waste materials for products related to basic needs by stimulating DIY and grassroots level entrepreneurship.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature Waste management is becoming a crucial issue in modern society owing to rapid urbanization and the increasing generation of municipal solid waste (MSW). This paper evaluates the carbon footprint of the waste management sector to identify direct and indirect carbon emissions, waste recycling carbon emission using a hybrid life cycle assessment and input-output analysis. China and Japan was selected as case study areas to highlight the effects of different industries on waste management. The results show that the life cycle carbon footprints for waste treatment are 59.01 million tons in China and 7.01 million tons in Japan. The gap between these footprints is caused by the different waste management systems and treatment processes used in the two countries. For indirect carbon footprints, China's material carbon footprint and depreciation carbon footprint are much higher than those of Japan, whereas the purchased electricity and heat carbon footprint in China is half that of Japan. China and Japan have similar direct energy consumption carbon footprints. However, CO2emissions from MSW treatment processes in China (46.46 million tons) is significantly higher than that in Japan (2.72 million tons). The corresponding effects of waste recycling on CO2emission reductions are considerable, up to 181.37 million tons for China and 96.76 million tons for Japan. Besides, measures were further proposed for optimizing waste management systems in the two countries. In addition, it is argued that the advanced experience that developed countries have in waste management issues can provide scientific support for waste treatment in developing countries such as China.},

abstract = {1H NMR and MALDI-TOF MS measurements were used to study the thermo-mechanical and thermooxidative degradation mechanisms of bottle-grade PET (btg-PET). In the thermo-oxidative degradation, the concentration of low molar mass compounds increased with time and the main products were cyclic and linear di-acid oligomers. In the thermo-mechanical degradation, the main-chain scission reactions affect the stability of the cyclic oligomers. One of the most important bottle-grade PET co-monomers is diethylene glycol (DEG), which is a "reactive site" in the thermal degradation of btg-PET. The DEG co-monomer was shown to be the precursor to colour changes in btg-PET, owing to the attack by molecular oxygen on the methylenic protons adjacent to the ether oxygen atoms of DEG. This behaviourwas observed in the thermooxidative degradation process in which the degradation of DEG causes the release of hydroxyl radicals in the polymeric matrix, thereby producing mono- and di-hydroxyl substituted species. Thiswas also observed in the thermo-mechanical degradation process. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {3D printable thermoreversible polyurethanes (PDAPUs) are synthesized, which facilitate the manufacturing of smart devices with 3D structures. The cross-linking of aniline trimer in PDAPUs plays a critical role in realizing light controllable precise selfhealing and targeted shape memory. The formation of durable 3D parts composed of functional polymers for intelligent devices such as robots is highly desirable. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis, 3D printing and applications of thermoreversible shape-memory polyurethanes (PDAPUs), which show good stability, ease of 3D printability, and excellent light control for precise self-healing and targeted shape memory (SM). As a breakthrough in the making of traditional smart devices, the combination of the 3D printing technology with SM characteristics facilitates the manufacturing of smart devices particularly with complex 3D structures, which enables arbitrary transformation between permanent and temporary 3D shapes. The reactive cross-linking of aniline trimer (AT) in PDAPU networks endows the polymers with improved mechanical properties and an efficient photothermal effect. Taking advantage of the spatial characteristics of 3D structures and the ease of control of light, the PDAPUs can achieve targeted shape restoration. Furthermore, the NIR laser can also be used to precisely trigger in situ self-healing of the PDAPUs without damaging their original 3D structures, which is particularly important for extending the lifespan of functional parts with specific structures. Moreover, the PDAPUs are recyclable and can be reprinted. The present research shows the promising potential of PDAPUs for next-generation intelligent devices. },

However, the emerging biomimetic studies have been of increasing interest for civil engineering design only in the past two decades. Bridge design is one of aspects on structural engineering of biomimetics that offers an enormous potential for inspiration in various aspects, such as the geometry, structure, mechanism, energy use and the intelligence. Recently built bridges and design proposals in which biological systems have produced a range of inspiration are reviewed in this paper. Multidisciplinary cooperation is discussed for the implementation of bio-inspired methods in future design. A case study about using bio-inspired strategy is trying to present a problem-solving approach, yet further cooperation is still needed to utilize biomimetic studies for design inspiration. This paper aims to call a close multidisciplinary collaboration that promotes engineers to build more sustainable and smart structural systems for bridges in the 21st century. {\textcopyright} 2013 Jilin University.},

abstract = {The concept of circular economy (CE) is to an increasing extent treated as a solution to series of challenges such as waste generation, resource scarcity and sustaining economic benefits. However the concept of circularity is not of novel as such. Specific circumstances and motivations have stimulated ideas relevant to circularity in the past through activities such as reuse, remanufacturing or recycling. Main objectives of this work are: to provide a comprehensive review of research efforts encompassing aspects of resources scarcity, waste generation and economic advantages; to explore the CE landscape in the context of these three aspects especially when they are considered simultaneously; based on an idea of a comprehensive CE framework, propose an implementation strategy using top-down and bottom-up approach in a concurrent manner. To fulfill this objective a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research is carried out to understand different ideas relevant to CE, motivation for the research and context of their recurrence. Main contributions of this paper are a comprehensive CE framework and a practical implementation strategy for a regenerative economy and natural environment. The framework emphasizes on a combined view of three main aspects i.e. environment, resources and economic benefits. It also underlines that joint support of all stakeholders is necessary in order to successfully implement the CE concept at large scale. The proposed framework and implementation strategy also identify new avenues for future research and practice in the field of CE.},

abstract = {It is more economic and environmental-friendly to use recycled plastics in manufacturing, especially under the context of circular economy. Since there are many which formulae exist which improve the different properties of recycled plastics, there is a need to develop decision support tools for evaluating the materials based on multiple properties. In this study, principal component analysis (PCA) was used as a decision support tool to evaluate the performance of plastic composites based on multiple properties. Cluster analysis (CA) was used for classify those properties. The base materials were polypropylene (PP), including a virgin PP (vPP) which is currently used in automobile industry and recycled PP (rPP) recovered from mixed scrap plastics. Two primary fillers were talcum powder (talc) and glass fibre (GF) which are commonly used in the composites for manufacturing industry, maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) was used as compatibiliser. Two vPP-based industrial composites for making automobile parts were used as comparatives. The materials were blended using a twin screw extruder, pelletized, and injected moulded into ISO standard sample specimens for ISO standard mechanical tests. The properties tested were tensile strength, yield strength, flexural modulus, flexural strength, and impact strength. The experimental results revealed that both virgin and recycled plastics are improved by the addition of fillers, and some properties of recycled plastics are better than those of industrial composites. Based on the experimental results, the multiple tested mechanical properties and the composites were classified by CA. Evaluation was performed by PCA, and the scores of some rPP based composites are higher than vPP based composites and industrial materials.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Polymer laser sintering (LS) is an important additive manufacturing (AM) technology. Individual and complex parts are directly produced from CAD data without the need of specific tools. The raw material is a polymer powder, which is deposited layerwise and melted selectively with a laser. Built parts are embedded in residual unmolten powder, the so-called part cake, which undergoes thermal ageing effects due to the exposure to high temperatures for long times during the manufacturing process. Hence, the recyclability of the unmolten powder is limited. This article focuses on a fundamental analysis of the ageing kinetics dependent on time, temperature, and oxygen content in the gas atmosphere. A model is developed and applied to measured, position-dependent process temperature histories to successfully predict the ageing distribution within a part cake. The results can be used to optimize the thermal process management in LS and to develop new efficient powder recycling methods.},

abstract = {The circular economy may help firms to maximize the value of their material resources and minimize the overall resource use, waste, pollution and emissions of their business activities. Implementing a circular economy program requires radical changes in product, business model and ecosystem innovation. Most research on circular oriented innovation takes a product or business model perspective. Few publications have explored how to innovate in ecosystems: how a group of loosely coupled organizations can change how they interact with each other to achieve a collective outcome. This study proposes the Circularity Deck: a card deck-based tool that can help firms to analyze, ideate and develop the circularity potential of their innovation ecosystems. The tool is based on a literature review of circular oriented innovation principles, and of practical examples that show how these principles have been applied. The principles are organized according to the intended circular strategy outcome that they pursue (i.e., narrow, slow, close, regenerate and inform material and energy flows), and the extent of the innovation perspective that is needed to operationalize a principle (i.e., product, business model, or ecosystem innovation). This review and categorization process first produced a novel analysis of the circular economy innovation landscape, using an ecosystem perspective. Second, these results served to develop the Circularity Deck, which was further developed and tested for ease of use and perceived usefulness in 12 workshops with 136 participants from 62 different organizations. The Circularity Deck provides an approach for future research and practice to integrate new principles and examples that can help firms to analyze, ideate and develop circular innovation ecosystems.},

Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3-D printed metal parts from an 1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy. These results thus provide methods with the removal of metal 3-D printed parts from print substrates with no specialized tooling or equipment conducive to distributed manufacturing.},

abstract = {A growing range of public, private and civic organisations, from Unicef through Nesta to NHS, now run units known as “innovation labs”. The hopeful assumption they share is that labs, by building on openness among other features, can generate promising solutions to grand challenges of systemic nature. Despite their seeming proliferation and popularisation, the underlying innovation principles embodied by labs have, however, received scant academic attention. This is a missed opportunity, because innovation labs appear to leverage openness for radical innovation in an unusual fashion. Indeed, in this exploratory paper we draw on original interview data and online self-descriptions to illustrate that, beyond convening “uncommon partners” across organisational boundaries, labs apply the principle of openness throughout the innovation process, including the experimentation and development phases. While the emergence of labs clearly forms part of a broader trend towards openness, we show how it transcends established conceptualisations of open innovation (Chesbrough, 2006), open science (David, 1998) or open government (Janssen et al., 2012).},

abstract = {This review critically discusses the environmental and resource implications for the design of sustainable biocomposites. Sustainable biocomposites should satisfy several requirements: (i) renewable and/or recycled resources should be utilized for their manufacture; (ii) the synthetic, modification, and processing operations should be benign and energy effective; (iii) no hazardous environmental or toxicological effects should arise during any stage of their life cycle; and (iv) their waste management options should be implemented. The future integration of biorefineries and green chemistry will guarantee the availability of a wide range of raw materials for their preparation. The emission of volatile organic compounds and the release of nanoparticles should be evaluated from a toxicological and environmental point of view. Finally, the susceptibility of sustainable biocomposites towards degradation, including abiotic effects (water absorption, thermo- and photo-oxidation) and biofilm formation and biodegradation, must be considered, to guarantee their structural and functional stability during service life, and to ensure their biodegradability and assimilation during composting. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A series of recent global and local policymaking processes is promoting or demanding developments in the recycling of post-consumer plastic packaging waste. After successfully clearing most hurdles in the PET bottle sector to promote a successful market launch of the recycled PET products, it is now important to take measures to meet the challenges associated with the recycling of polyolefins such as HDPE. In this respect, the need to further improve recycling technologies is currently prevalent because the quality parameters of the recycled materials do not yet meet the strict industrial requirements. In this context, apart from optical or mechanical properties, there is increasing awareness of odorous contaminants in the recycled products. Therefore, in this study, a modified HDPE recycling method was evaluated for its ability to reduce odors. For the aim of mapping and understanding the odor of recycled HDPE pellets with different residence times in a special decontamination reactor a combinatory sensory and instrumental-olfactometric approach was applied. Furthermore, based on the characterization of the causative odorants by gas chromatography-olfactometry and two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry, quantitative determination of selected odorants was carried out over time using stable isotope dilution analysis. With regard to the decontamination efficacy of the evaluated decontamination process, we observed that the decrease in the concentration profiles of the monitored odorants went along with a sensorially relevant overall odor minimization of the recycled HDPE. The results of the study are aiding the adaptation of technological procedures for smell reduction or complete decontamination.},

abstract = {This research is implemented in the backdrop of the increasing number of private universities established in China over the last decade, and a growing public concern of sustainable development. The private university has a different reputation and source of funding compared with the public one, leading to different perception and practices toward sustainable development. Yet, none of past studies have investigated into public and private universities in the Chinese context, making this study fill this gap through comparing students' perception in Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering (a public university) and Guangzhou College of South China University of Technology (a private university). By using the five-point Likert scale questionnaire, 393 students from the public university and 347 students from the private university participated in the survey. The results reveal that students have greatest concern with sustainability commitment and their university's role for promoting sustainable development, and have least concern with sustainability curricula and research. Compared with students from the public university, students in the private one more often agree on the importance of sustainable development, and have a higher level of perception about commitment, knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward sustainability. The study findings assert that the higher level of perception from private university's students is due to active campus sustainability engagement and positive stakeholder relationship managed by university management. The study implies that higher education needs to decentralize sustainable plans and decision-making to students, staff, and faculty, and public universities need to incorporate more sustainability-related context into curriculum and academic project.},

In order for a circular economy to materialize, an integrated approach that focuses on a long-term system change or transition is required. To set the change process in motion, many (public and private) players (companies, authorities, citizens, and research institutions) need to be involved. Among the many stakeholders, a genuine enabler to implement a successful and sustainable circular strategy is the logistics industry. Given that The Netherlands is used as a case study, in this paper, we focus on the Dutch logistics industry and how this industry can contribute to the broader Dutch agenda to realize a more circular economy. It implies looking at the specific transition agenda for the logistics industry in relation to a circular economy, what barriers may exist that might hamper such a transition, and how public policy-makers are dealing with and can tackle these barriers.},

abstract = {A cleaner production pattern for high-performance continuous carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTPCs) has been proposed on the base of recycling and remanufacturing of 3D printed continuous carbon fiber reinforced (CFR) PLA composites. Continuous carbon fiber and PLA matrix was recycled in the form of PLA impregnated carbon fiber filament from 3D printed composite components and reused as the raw material for further 3D printing process. The original printing trajectory is reversely applied, allowing for a 100{\%} recycling of the continuous fiber without any effect on the mechanical properties. Tensile performance of recycled carbon fiber filaments was evaluated, which was higher than that of originally printed composites. Remanufactured CFRTPCs specimens also exhibited a 25{\%} higher bending strength than that of original ones, which experimentally demonstrated the first non-downgrade recycling process for CFRTPCs. A material recovery rate of 100{\%} for continuous carbon fiber and 73{\%} for PLA matrix were achieved for a better environmental impact. Energy consumption of 67.7 and 66 MJ/kg respectively for recycling and remanufacturing processes was detected and compared with conventional methods. The proposed cleaner production pattern offered a potential strategy for the low-cost industrial application of fully recyclable composites.},

abstract = {Although multi-material fused deposition modelling (FDM) has shown good progress and potential for industrial and scientific development, differences in physical and chemical properties cause weak bond strength between dissimilar materials in multi-material FDM parts. This paper proposes a single-layer temperature-adjusting transition (SLTAT) method to improve bond strength between dissimilar materials with different melting temperatures by adjusting the bonding-layer temperature. Herein, the bonding-layer temperature effects on the tensile strength of polycaprolactone (PCL)/polylactic acid (PLA) structures were investigated. PCL/PLA parts prepared with this method had 28{\%} higher tensile strength than unprocessed parts when the bonding-layer temperature was 130 °C. Bonding mechanism was proposed to explain the failure modes of the PCL/PLA parts after tensile testing. Freeze-fractured surfaces of SLTAT-processed PCL/PLA specimens were observed to better understand the correlations between bonding-layer temperature and tensile strength. This approach is promising to apply in ordinary multi-material FDM processing without adding additional equipment or compromising dimensional accuracy.},

One of these necessities is the correct management of the waste that is daily produced by these communities. Universities are a good example of institution where every day a great amount of people go to work or to study. But independently of their task, they use the different services at the University such as cafeterias, canteens, and photocopy and as a result of their activity a cleaning service is also needed. All these activities generate an environmental impact. Nowadays, many Universities have accepted the challenge to minimize this impact applying several measures. One of the impacts to be reduced is the waste generation. The first step to implement measures to implement a waste management plan at a University is to know the composition, the amount and the distribution of the waste generated in its facilities. As the waste composition and generation depend among other things on the climate, these variables should be analysed over one year. This research work estimates the waste generation and composition of a Spanish University, the Universitat Jaume I, during a school year. To achieve this challenge, all the waste streams generated at the University have been identified and quantified emphasizing on those which are not controlled. Furthermore, several statistical analyses have been carried out to know if the season of the year or the day of the week affect waste generation and composition. All this information will allow the University authorities to propose a set of minimization measures to enhance the current management.},

FDM process has been introduced commercially in early 1990s by Stratasys Inc., USA. The quality of FDM processed parts mainly depends on careful selection of process variables. Thus, identification of the FDM process parameters that significantly affect the quality of FDM processed parts is important. In recent years, researchers have explored a number of ways to improve the mechanical properties and part quality using various experimental design techniques and concepts. This article aims to review the research carried out so far in determining and optimizing the process parameters of the FDM process. Several statistical designs of experiments and optimization techniques used for the determination of optimum process parameters have been examined. The trends for future FDM research in this area are described.},

Affect and mitigation response inefficacy were also important predictors of behavioural willingness, but socio-cultural influences (free-market ideology, prescriptive norms, and biospheric values) played a relatively larger role in explaining the variance of behavioural willingness. Structural equation modelling provided further evidence that risk perception and behavioural willingness are separable constructs, as some factors in the model had direct effects on willingness independent of risk perception. We discuss the need for future research to develop a comprehensive model of behavioural willingness, and the need for public communication to combat mitigation response inefficacy.},

abstract = {Two treatment options, i.e. energy recovery and mechanical recycling of plastic wastes from discarded TV sets, were compared in the context of life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. An estimate for the environmental burden of each option was calculated as the sum of the depletion of abiotic resources (ADP), the global warming potential (GWP), the acidification potential (AP), the photo-oxidant formation potential (POCP), the eutrophication potential (EP), and the human toxicity potential (HTP). After calculating the environmental burden of each treatment option, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. The ultimate aim was to indicate which parameters of the system have the strongest influence on the results of the LCA in order to find ways for lowering the environmental burden, and ultimately suggest a "design strategy" for TV sets. The main finding of this study was that mechanical recycling of plastics is more attractive treatment option in environmental terms than incineration for energy recovery, which generates a larger environmental burden. Finally, based on the results of sensitivity analysis, a "design strategy" was suggested, i.e. reducing the number of plastic types being used in the manufacturing process of TVs - preferably excluding the PVC. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This is because, as the characteristics of agriculture and manufacturing differ, the basic characteristics of industries related to the 4th industrial revolution differ from those of manufacturing. Differences in the way agriculture and manufacturing value is created require differences in human type, social systems, and even distribution system. That is, just as ecosystems focus on the interrelationship of organisms and their relationship with the physical environment, the industrial ecosystems to be accompanied by the 4th industrial revolution require new human beings to live in the new industrial ecosystem and new systems to support the new industrial ecosystem, with new technologies in the related fields.

Four mechanisms are applied in pilot areas to observe the differences in behavior. A traditional mechanism is introduced to the community as the first campaign followed by a voluntary mechanism, which is another non-economic incentive mechanism. Next, two economic incentive mechanisms, namely, a reward mechanism and a community business mechanism, are applied. These four mechanisms were applied in the Nakhon Ratchasima metropolitan area, one of the largest commercialized cities in northeastern Thailand, in 2010. The study found that the traditional mechanism yields a 19{\%} organic waste separation efficiency. When the voluntary mechanism is applied, the efficiency increases to 36{\%}. The economic incentive mechanism further increases the waste separation behavior: the reward mechanism increases the efficiency to 51{\%}, and the community business mechanism is the best mechanism, with an efficiency of 58{\%} being observed. The study also found that housing style influences the quantity of organic waste separation, while community style influences the quality of organic waste separation. These results are helpful in devising appropriate management plans for enhancing waste management practices, which will directly improve the sustainability of using organic waste in future energy projects.},

abstract = {This chapter explores the processes of a typical logistics network for the management of reusable packaging for food products. While the impacts associated with packaging waste in the food sector are well known, the adoption of reusable crates or handling systems for food items entails many logistics processes such as storage, transportation, and cleaning, whose impact needs to be quantified and assessed with cost-benefit analysis. This chapter thus presents a methodology and a decision-support tool used to quantify the logistic and environmental impacts associated with packaging distribution in the closed-loop network between growers, retailers, and the pooler.This methodology allows quantifying of the performance of the as-is scenario and predicting the savings of choosing intermodal transport solutions (i.e., railways, seaways) for the delivery and collection of reusable plastic crates (RPCs) for fruits and vegetables. The methodology is applied to a multiscenario what-if analysis of a case study provided by an Italian pooler operating in the retail food supply chain. The results are generated through a decision-support tool, which embeds a geographic information system (GIS) and realizes data-driven assessment of storage and distribution operations experienced by RPCs. We quantified some categories of impacts among the set of greenhouse gases emissions (GHGs) resulting from transportation and associated costs. The results showcase a total transportation cost reduction of 11.7{\%} in the to-be scenario, while the number of kilograms of CO2eq decreases by 9.2{\%}. The contribution of this chapter lies in the investigation of the environmental sustainability of a packaging closed-loop network (CLN) for food products. Moreover, we decided to limit the boundaries of the analysis to the transport process, which is often neglected and underrated in typical life cycle assessment (LCA). Findings from this chapter represent practical suggestions and strategic guidelines for managers and practitioners of reusable package systems toward more sustainable operations.},

abstract = {The extrusion system is an integral part of any fused deposition style 3D printing technique. However, the extruder designs found in commercial and hobbyist printers are mostly suitable for materials in filament form. While printing with a filament is not a problem per se, the printing of materials that may not be readily available in the filament form or not commercially viable remains untapped, e.g., biopolymers and material blends. This is particularly an issue in the research and hobbyist space where the capability of printing a variety of materials or materials recycled from already printed parts may be of utmost importance. This paper presents a pellet-based extrusion system for the 3D printing of biopolymers. The system has been designed from the first principles and therefore can be extended to other materials with parameter adjustments or slight hardware modifications. A robust mechatronic design has been realized using an unconventional yet simplistic approach. The extrusion system uses a series of control factors to generate a consistent output of material over the course of a print. The platform and surrounding processes are set up so that software can be used to define the printing parameters; this allows a simpler adaption to different materials. The utility of the extruder is demonstrated through extensive printing and testing of the printed parts.},

abstract = {Purpose: To review the state-of-the-art in smart remanufacturing, highlighting key elements of an Industry 4.0 (I4.0) future that supports circular economy (CE) principles and offer a conceptual framework and research agenda to accelerate digitalisation in this sector. Design/methodology/approach: The Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect databases and search terms “Industry 4.0”, “Internet of things”, “Smart manufacturing” and “Remanufacturing” were used to identify and select publications that had evidence of a relationship between those keywords. The 329 selected papers were reviewed with respect to the triple bottom line (economic, social and environmental). The study benefited from advanced text quantitative processing using NVivo software and a complete manual qualitative assessment. Findings: Changes in product ownership models will affect the remanufacturing industry, with the growth of product-service-systems seen as an opportunity to re-circulate resources and create value. This is being supported by changes in society, user expectations and workforce attributes. Key to the success of remanufacturing in an I4.0 future is the uptake of existing and emerging digital technologies to shorten and strengthen links between product manufacturers, users and remanufacturers. Originality/value: Remanufacturing is recognised as a key CE strategy, which in turn is an important research area for development in our society. This article is the first to study “smart remanufacturing” for the CE. Its uniqueness lies in its focus on the remanufacturing industry and the sustainable application of I4.0 enablers. The findings are used to create a framework that links to the research agenda needed to realise smart remanufacturing.},

The effect of cooling the samples during the process was also considered. The experimental study was performed according to a mixed type Taguchi L16 orthogonal array. The effectiveness of each parameter was also discussed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The tensile strength results were compatible with the optical images of the fracture surfaces while the surface roughness results were compatible with the surface topography of the parts along the thickness. The two dominant quality characteristics were found to be layer thickness and deposition head velocity. Lower layer thickness values yielded higher tensile strength and lower surface roughness. Use of a cooling fan and nozzle temperature were found to be the least effective parameters. Finally, the results indicated that tensile strength and surface quality of the FDM samples improved about 25 {\%}, and 12 {\%}, respectively at optimal process conditions.},

abstract = {Selective openness allows a firm to sell a systemic innovation that combines both open and proprietary technologies. Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.},

abstract = {Both, for ecological and economic reasons, the recycling of plastics for new or broader applications is currently gaining more and more attention. As high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plays an essential role in various packaging, the recycling of this material is particularly sought for. Thereby, odorous contaminants are a common obstacle when aiming at achieving high-quality HDPE recycled goods. In this respect, revealing the differences in the odorant composition of waste, recycled pellets and virgin pellets provides insights into odor sources and formation pathways and therefore supports the developing of optimized avoidance strategies. For this reason, the odor of post-consumer HDPE waste, corresponding recycled HDPE pellets and virgin HDPE granules was analyzed in the frame of the present study by comprehensive sensory analysis as well as instrumental analysis using high resolution gas chromatography-olfactometry followed by two-dimensional high resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry. In total, 32 odorous substances were identified. While some oxidation products were present in all three samples, albeit mostly with much higher smell intensity when regarding the waste and the recycled pellets, a number of terpenes as well as phenylpropanoids were found only in the HDPE waste and recycled material and, in most cases, with high sensory abundance. These odorants are likely to stem from fragrances used in cosmetics and washing/cleaning agents. Moreover, comparative odor extract dilution analysis (cOEDA) revealed that the applied conventional recycling process resulted only in a slight reduction of the odor pollution; moreover, it could be shown that no new odorants were generated to any relevant extent. Accordingly, this study shows that further optimized strategies for odorant removal from post-consumer recycled HDPE material are required.},

abstract = {Concerning individualization, the requirements to products have increased. Additive manufacturing technologies, such as selective laser melting allow manufacturing of complex parts without tools and forms. Due to this additive manufacturing processes comply, in opposite to conventional techniques, with these increased demands on processing technology. Due to the high temperature during processing, a degradation of the used plastic powder occurs. The non-molten material in the building chamber, the so-called partcake, can be removed after building from the finished component and reused for another process. To realize reproducible part properties refreshing of partcake powder with 30 up to 50 {\%} virgin powder is necessary. However, these refreshing strategies lead to varying component properties due to an undefined aging state. Previous investigations on oven aged powder for selective laser melting showed for short periods of storage near the melting point thermally induced post condensation is the predominate aging effect. Due to post condensation the molecular weight and thus the viscosity increases. This paper focuses on the modeling of the post condensation process to define the aging state of polyamide 12 powder in laser melting process. Therefore the rheological behavior of PA 12 powder in dependency of time and temperature is investigated. Isothermal viscosity measurements are conducted in order to describe the post condensation$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreaction with a model. With knowledge of the kinetics of the post condensation$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreaction the state of aging can be predicted in a second step. Thus expected useful life of the powder can be calculated in dependency of the building chamber temperature. These results are then compared with viscosity values of defined aged PA 12 powder to validate the determined model.},

abstract = {Abstract: A minimum necessary condition for sustainability is the maintenance of the total natural capital stock at or above the current level. While a lower stock of natural capital may be sustainable, society can allow no further decline in natural capital given the large uncertainty and the dire consequences of guessing wrong. This “constancy of total natural capital” rule can thus be seen as a prudent minimum condition for assuring sustainability, to be relaxed only when solid evidence can be offered that it is safe to do so. We discuss methodological issues concerning the degree of substitutability of manufactured for natural capital, quantifying ecosystem services and natural capital, and the role of the discount rate in valuing natural capital. We differentiate the concepts of growth (material increase in size) and development (improvement in organization without size change). Given these definitions, growth cannot the sustainable indefinitely on a finite planet. Development may be sustainable, but even this aspect of change may have some limits. One problem is that current measures of economic well‐being at the macro level (i.e., the Gross National Product) measure mainly growth, or at best conflate growth and development. This urgently requires revision. Finally, we suggest some principles of sustainable development and describe why maintaining natural capital stocks is a prudent and achievable policy for insuring sustainable development. There is disagreement between technological optimists (who see technical progress as eliminating all resource constraints to growth and development) and technological skeptics (who do not see as much scope for this approach and fear irreversible use of resources and damage to natural capital). By maintaining natural capital stocks (preferably by using a natural capital depletion tax), we can satisfy both the skeptics (since resources will be conserved for future generations) and the optimists (since this will raise the price of natural capital depletion and more rapidly induce the technical change they predict).

Sixty-three participants (M = 22.7 years; SD = 3.4 years), with no previous dental training, were randomly allocated to one of three groups (n = 21 each). Group 1 received device-only feedback during the training phase, that is the visual display of the simulator (DFB); Group 2 received verbal feedback from a qualified dental instructor (IFB); and Group 3 received a combination of instructor and device feedback (IDFB). Participants completed four tasks during which feedback was given according to group allocation as well as two skills transfer tests. Skill retention was examined immediately after training, at 1 week and at 1 month post-test. Statistically significant differences were found between the groups in overall performance (P {\textless} 0.001) and error (P = 0.006). Post hoc comparisons revealed the IDFB group produced substantially better performance and fewer errors in comparison with DFB and IFB training. This difference translated to improved performance in skill retention and generalisation of knowledge to novel tasks. These data indicate that the acquisition and retention of basic dental motor skills in novice trainees is best optimised through a combination of instructor and visual display (VR)-driven feedback. The results have implications for the utility and implementation of VR haptic technology in dental education.},

However, as they are being embodied under different names and shaped by their context, they also seem to operate freely under multiple-related innovation approaches. This is leading to a grey-zone within the universe of innovation laboratories, making them difficult to study and manage. In this paper, Innovation laboratories are studied as innovation intermediaries that fulfil the purpose of creating communities of knowledge imbued with values of sharing and collaborating towards a common objective or project. Through a bibliometric study, a scientific outlook for the constellation of Innovation laboratories is built. Research affinities and distinctions between the most common concepts often related to these innovation intermediaries are discussed.

In addition, it reveals four role patterns characteristic of living labs: (i) ambidexterity, (ii) reciprocity, (iii) temporality, and (iv) multiplicity. These patterns distinguish actor collaboration in networks characterized by heterogeneous actors, the coexistence of individual and shared motives, high degree of openness, and user involvement.

abstract = {This paper examines the differences between online synchronous and offline face-to-face collaboration in the context of a computer-supported modeling task. A mathematical problem was designed and set to the participants to solve. Their modeling process using ModellingSpace, a collaborative computer-supported educational environment, was monitored. 16 ninth grade students participated in the study, all worked in groups of two. Eight groups worked online, the remaining 8 offline. The analysis focused on the identification of students' cognitive modeling strategies, their interactions and the learning gain for each type of collaboration. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were adopted as well as two complementary coding schemes to better investigate the peers' interactions. The results obtained suggest that pairs who worked online emphasized analysis and synthesis; they also demonstrated a higher learning gain. Offline pairs needed the teacher's support and demonstrated stronger social interaction. Moreover, although the actions of offline dyads were more numerous, the dyads that worked online seemed to present more task-oriented actions. Participants in both groups mutually explored the problem, with few disagreements among them. Our findings could inform the design of learning programs and the facilitation of collaborative tasks.},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical and experimental study of the compression uniaxial properties of PLA material manufactured with FDM based on product specifications. A first experimental test in accordance with the requirements and conditions established in the ISO 604 standard characterizes the mechanical and elastic properties of PLA manufactured with FDM technology and product requirements in a uniaxial compression stress field by testing six specimens. A second experimental test allows analyzing the structural behavior of the industrial case, evaluating the compression stiffness, the compression yield stress, the field of displacements, and stress along its elastic area until reaching the compression yield stress and the ultimate yield stress data. To improve the structural analysis of the case study, a numerical validation was carried out using two analytical models. The first analytical model applies an interpolation procedure to the experimental results of the tested specimens in order to characterize the uniaxial tension-compression curve versus the nominal deformations by means of an 8-degree polynomial function. The second model defines the plastic material as elastic and isotropic with Young's compression modulus constant and according to the guidelines established in ISO standard 604. The comparison between experimental tests and numerical simulation results for the study case verify that the new model that uses the proposed polynomial function is closer to the experimental solution with only an 0.36{\%} error, in comparison with the model with Young's compression modulus constant that reaches an error of 4.27{\%}. The results of the structural analysis of the mechanical element indicate that the elastic region of the plastic material PLA manufactured with FDM can be modeled numerically as an isotropic material, using the elastic properties from the experimental results of the specimens tested according to ISO standard 604. In this way, it is possible to characterize the PLA FDM material as isotropic, obtaining as an advantage its easy definition in the numerical simulation software as it does not require the modification of the constitutive equations in the material database. SEM micrographs have indicated that the fracture of the failed test specimens is of the brittle type, mainly caused by the separation between the central plastic filament layers of the specimens. The results presented suggest that the use of FDM technology with PLA material is promising for the manufacture of low volume industrial components that are subject to compression efforts or for the manufacture of components by the user. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {Objectives: To compare traditional plaster casts, digital models and 3D printed copies of dental plaster casts based on various criteria. To determine whether 3D printed copies obtained using open source system RepRap can replace traditional plaster casts in dental practice. To compare and contrast the qualities of two possible 3D printing options - open source system RepRap and commercially available 3D printing.Design and settings: A method comparison study on 10 dental plaster casts from the Orthodontic department, Department of Stomatology, 2nd medical Faulty, Charles University Prague, Czech Republic.Material and methods: Each of 10 plaster casts were scanned by inEos Blue scanner and the printed on 3D printer RepRap [10 models] and ProJet HD3000 3D printer [1 model]. Linear measurements between selected points on the dental arches of upper and lower jaws on plaster casts and its 3D copy were recorded and statistically analyzed.Results: 3D printed copies have many advantages over traditional plaster casts. The precision and accuracy of the RepRap 3D printed copies of plaster casts were confirmed based on the statistical analysis. Although the commercially available 3D printing enables to print more details than the RepRap system, it is expensive and for the purpose of clinical use can be replaced by the cheaper prints obtained from RepRap printed copies.Conclusions: Scanning of the traditional plaster casts to obtain a digital model offers a pragmatic approach. The scans can subsequently be used as a template to print the plaster casts as required. Using 3D printers can replace traditional plaster casts primarily due to their accuracy and price. {\textcopyright} 2013 Kasparova et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {A large amount of food is lost along the entire food supply chain, causing serious environmental, economic and social impacts and most food is wasted during the final consumption phase especially in industrialized countries. Starting from the analysis of the main regulations and initiatives at various administrative levels and by introducing a two-level framework for modelling complex household food waste behaviour, this paper aims at investigating the behaviour of EU-27 citizens towards food waste by referring to the 2013 Flash Eurobarometer survey (n. 388).The multilevel statistical perspective enabled us to jointly consider factors at both individual and contextual levels as potential variables associated with food waste.Firstly, by analysing territorial variability it was possible to identify groups of countries characterized by similar behaviour patterns and therefore target them according to the need and exigency of public policy interventions.Secondly, at individual level it was observed that people living in towns and large cities tend to produce more waste thus emphasizing the need of diversifying policy interventions at local level according to the extent of urbanization. Moreover, education level, sorting practices, attitudes and concern regarding food waste proved to be associated with individuals' behaviour towards food waste.Thirdly, public-private partnerships as well as targeting community-based interventions to address food waste should be encouraged.},

In recent years, reverse engineering technology has developed rapidly, through which the digital computer-aided design (CAD) models of products can be obtained rapidly and accurately; in association with optimization design, computer aided design and finite element analysis, reverse engineering technology significantly improves the development efficiency of new products. As one of the representative technologies of the third industrial revolution, three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is adopted in reverse engineering to realize rapid manufacturing of products in a lot of fields; in addition, 3D printing is gradually penetrating into each link of product design, attracting more and more attention from industrial and investment communities. {\&}copy; 2016, Allerton Press, Inc.},

abstract = {Purpose – By comparing two small high-tech firms specialising in medical technology this article seeks to answer the following questions: What are the key characteristics of innovation processes in the case firms? How do the mutual relationships between mental, social and physical spaces explain the different pathways in the innovation processes in the firms? Design/methodology/approach – One case is based on an in-depth study conducted by the authors. Regarding the other case, a secondary analysis is conducted of a case described in the literature. Both cases apply several data sources. The case firms are comparable in their most crucial aspects (field, main product, geographical location, joint learning space in the start-up phase). Findings – The firms have many similar features. The study, however, draws attention to the factors that have made them substantially different as contexts of innovation activities. The differences are interpreted through the concepts of physical, social and mental space. Special attention is paid to the tightness/permeability of boundaries circumscribing spaces and to how this condition supports/inhibits cooperation between different occupational groups in the product planning process. Tightness of boundaries is not unambiguously a good or a bad thing but permeable boundaries are needed when a mix of different knowledge bases is vital. Research limitations/implications – The focus remains within the firms. Innovation activities extend also beyond the borders of the organisation. Practical implications – Management should be aware of the productive and counterproductive effects of spaces and the means to influence their shaping. Originality/value – The study highlights the potential of the concept of space in an empirical comparative setting for studying organisational prerequisites for innovation processes and related learning and cooperation.},

abstract = {The growing plastic waste problem has been highlighted by nature programmes like the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) War on Plastic series with the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2016 report estimating that by 2050, there could be more plastic than fish in the world's oceans. This has prompted the call for a shift from the linear model of tackling the plastic waste issue to that of a Circular Economy model with increasing demand for recycled resin to be incorporated into the plastic production process alongside virgin resin. However, recycled content are often associated with problems like lack of stability between various combinations of virgin/recycle polymers, which may lead to variations in temperature and inconsistency in the ease of flow attributable to the different temperature and pressure regimes under which virgin raw material and recycled feedstock melt and cool. In this paper, our main contribution is a proposed framework for integrating an enhanced AI/DB interface for analysing historical and real time information/data into a joint DSC-TGA system that allows for simultaneous quality control checks and thermal stability tests on different virgin-recycled resin mixing ratios. The database comes equipped with proven estimation methods, testing and statistical analysis results of different resin specimens to serve as a reference point for production engineers in arriving at desired check and test conditions. The information will be particularly useful to plastic product manufacturers when making decisions regarding the right virgin-recycled mix ratio conditions when using different batches of recycled resin or when they switch a supplier.},

abstract = {Within the last few decades, plastics have revolutionized our daily lives. Globally we use in excess of 260 million tonnes of plastic per annum, accounting for approximately 8 per cent of world oil production. In this Theme Issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, we describe current and future trends in usage, together with the many benefits that plastics bring to society. At the same time, we examine the environmental consequences resulting from the accumulation of waste plastic, the effects of plastic debris on wildlife and concerns for human health that arise from the production, usage and disposal of plastics. Finally, we consider some possible solutions to these problems together with the research and policy priorities necessary for their implementation.},

abstract = {This paper examines our understanding of recycling behaviour in the context of its increasing normalisation in the UK. It reflects on the recent history of dry recycling (i.e. recycling of 'dry' materials such as paper, glass, plastics and cans) and asks the question as to what influence policy drivers and the increased provision of facilities for recycling have had on people's behaviour. In reviewing the evidence for recycling being considered a norm, this paper explores what influence norms, habit and identities have on recycling behaviour. It then considers what lessons the evidence offers for using the normalisation of recycling behaviour in influencing more people to recycle and to adopt other sustainable behaviours. The somewhat contentious issue of whether engaging in recycling behaviours has a positive or negative effect on people engaging with other pro-environmental behaviours is discussed. The evidence shows that both positive and negative spillover occurs and understanding where the balance lies, as well as what effect recycling being a norm plays in this, is important in determining appropriate interventions to influence pro-environmental behaviours. The paper concludes with some observations on implications of the evidence on intervention approaches to influence pro-environmental behaviours. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {With the emergence of extended producer responsibility regulations for electronic devices, it is becoming increasingly important for electronics manufacturers to apply design for recycling (DFR) methods in the design of plastic enclosures. This paper presents an analytical framework for quantifying the environmental and economic benefits of DFR for plastic computer enclosures during the design process, using straightforward metrics that can be aligned with corporate environmental and financial performance goals. The analytical framework is demonstrated via a case study of a generic desktop computer enclosure design, which is recycled using a typical US "take-back" system for plastics from waste electronics. The case study illustrates how the analytical framework can be used by the enclosure designer to quantify the environmental and economic benefits of two important DFR strategies: choosing high-value resins and minimizing enclosure disassembly time. Uncertainty analysis is performed to quantify the uncertainty surrounding economic conditions in the future when the enclosure is ultimately recycled. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The mass production of polymer products, in particular plastics, and their widespread use depending on the inherent advantages they have, make these materials ironically a threat to life on Earth. Polymer recycling is being considered as one of the most widely accepted remedies to the threat of growing amounts of plastic waste by both the public and scientists. In practice, recycling is associated with many difficulties, such as problems related to separation, sorting and cleaning operations, lack of fiscal subsidies, instability of selective garbage separation programs, high transport and electricity costs, etc. Still, a large section of society and the authorities agree on the necessity and importance of recycling to protect the environment, and natural habitats and resources for future generations in a balanced manner to conserve raw materials, and to reduce energy consumption, municipal solid waste production and greenhouse gas emission. The recycling effort is almost endless in itself and includes a variety of approaches such as refurbishing, mechanically reshaping, chemically treating, thermally utilizing, etc. Some novel approaches such as application in carbon capture or synthesis of carbon nanostructures from the plastic waste are among the new process technologies of recycling. From traditional and promising polymer waste utilization approaches, this review will highlight sustainable methods to reduce impacts of plastic waste on the environment. {\textcopyright} 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.},

Today, most learning factories focus on the actual manufacturing system. Some learning factories extend the perspective and include the product development and product use phase. To enlarge the learning perspective towards end-of-life an existing learning factory is extended by a modular, self-designed recycling process chain enabling closed-loop manufacturing. The modular process chain consists of crushing end-of-life products and extruding new filament out of the shredded material. The filament is then utilized to create new products with 3D-printers substituting virgin material. The developed recycling process chain is implemented in an existing learning environment which is equipped with 3D-printers. Further didactic courses are designed considering the ageing of the material and the environmental impact along the product's life cycle.},

abstract = {In modern industry, mass production has migrated to third world countries. To be competitive, European companies are forced to rapidly switch towards manufacturing of short series of customised products with added value. In European industry, a great effort has been made in order to customise products and give them an added value by developing new fabrication technologies. Additive layered manufacturing (ALM), also known as rapid manufacturing (RM), is a powerful tool that offers the necessary competitiveness to European companies. ALM comprises the use of layer-by-layer manufacturing in order to build a part by addition of material. Fabrication is performed directly from the 3D CAD model, which is sliced into layers that are printed one upon the other. Also known as free form fabrication, additive fabrication ‘unlocks' design potential since part design obeys functionality, pushing the limits of manufacturability. In this paper, the authors review ALM technologies and the state-of-the-art of ALM applications in tooling, biomedicine and lightweight structures for the automotive and aerospace sectors. The authors present their experience in industrial application of additive fabrication through various industrial technology transfer projects made to transfer ALM technology to SMEs. Various case studies are presented and the achieved benefits of ALM are shown.},

abstract = {This research aims to evaluate the engineering students' perception regarding sustainability. For this, a survey was developed based on sustainability parameters from a detailed analysis of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Brazilian Institute of Corporate Governance (BICG). The parameters were initially divided into seven groups: Financial and Productivity Aspects (FPA); Concern With Employees (CWE); Support for Local Communities (SLC); Ethical and Corporate Governance Issues (ECI); Environmental Aspects (ENA); Sustainable Aspects in the Operations Network (SON); Customers, Development of New Products and Services (CPS). The survey was conducted with engineering undergraduate students from two Brazilian universities. The data were analyzed through structural equation modeling technique, namely the PLS-SEM algorithm. The collected 162 answers enabled the validation of the model tested, and showed that the students, in general, do not consider SLC and CWE when they are analyzing sustainability. Additionally, the most important construct was the CPS. This is an exploratory study and we believe that these findings may contribute to expand the debate about the sustainability insertion in engineering courses, helping educators in their didactic activities. There were not found similar studies in the literature, which highlight the originality of the research. The statistical validation of the results and the contribution to expand the debate regarding sustainability in engineering education justify the value of this study.},

However, once these thermosetting photopolymers form 3D parts through photopolymerization, the covalent networks are permanent and cannot be reprocessed, i.e., reshaped, repaired, or recycled. Here, we report a two-step polymerization strategy to develop 3D printing reprocessable thermosets (3DPRTs) that allow users to reform a printed 3D structure into a new arbitrary shape, repair a broken part by simply 3D printing new material on the damaged site, and recycle unwanted printed parts so the material can be reused for other applications. These 3DPRTs provide a practical solution to address environmental challenges associated with the rapid increase in consumption of 3D printing materials.},

abstract = {Organizational work environments are increasingly strategically designed to support creativity and innovation processes, although a consistent theoretical frame for such an endeavour has not been developed yet. Creativity- and innovation-oriented design of work environments requires an understanding of the principles of the underlying processes and their spatial implications. Both creativity and innovation processes are complex and display in different phases convergent and divergent characteristics. The processes are dependent on both individual and group effort. In this article these dimensions are discussed from a theoretical perspective and are used for evaluating the two cases presented here. The first case, the Interactive Creativity Landscape as integral part of the Fraunhofer Office Innovation Center in Germany has been designed interpreting the convergent and divergent phases of creative processes. The second case, the Learning Garden of a Scandinavian financial institution has been designed having de Bono's procedure in mind. The article concludes with the suggestion that increasingly organizations will offer diversity for spatially supporting creativity and innovation processes; solutions will be manifold but will follow certain principles - some of which are discussed here.},

For this reason, 3D technology is driving major innovations in food industry. Here, we review the use of 3D printing techniques to design food materials. Our discussions bring a new insight into how essential food material properties behave during application of 3D printing techniques. We suggest that the rational design of 3D food constructs relies on three key factors: (1) printability, (2) applicability and (3) post-processing. Especial emphasis is devoted to how the advantages/limitations of 3D printing techniques affect the end-use properties of the printed food constructs.},

@article{Timlett2009,
abstract = {This research paper explores the role of transience in kerbside recycling performance in Portsmouth, a Southern English city and one of the most densely populated in Europe. Recycling in an urban environment is difficult; UK authorities failing to meet their recycling targets are predominantly cities where medium and high density housing causes problems for collections that rely on householder segregation of waste. Since urban areas are likely to become more densely populated, the waste management issues arising in Portsmouth may be illustrative of those likely to be faced by authorities with high rates of population flux and high population densities in future, especially university towns and cities. A recycling participation survey of 62,299 households was carried out in June-July 2005 and repeated in June-July 2007. Householder participation in the kerbside scheme was recorded over three consecutive collections (6 weeks). There was very little change in overall participation between the two surveys, with 78.4{\%} of households participating in recycling in 2005 and 78.2{\%} in 2007. Although this shows recycling to be the "normal" activity, conducted by most households in both surveys, 10{\%} of households were found to be "new recyclers" and 10{\%} seemed to stop recycling (i.e. they were found to be recycling in 2005 but not in 2007), with the more densely populated areas being "hot spots" of change. As a consequence, 3 months after the 2007 participation survey, approximately 1300 "stopped recycling" households were surveyed by a team of doorsteppers to discuss why they apparently stopped recycling during the survey period. A key issue was population transience, which was found to be greater in urban areas. It seems that once the recycling habit is established it is very difficult to break. Changes in "physical" circumstances were the drivers behind those properties that stopped recycling: a change of address, a change in occupants, a bin going missing. A four-group recycling behaviour typology (sustained recycler, non-recycler, stopped recycler, and new recycler) emerges, which will be useful for many urban waste authorities in monitoring and analysing their own recycling performance. It is clear from this study that policies to concentrate population and to increase recycling rates in urban areas could potentially conflict. Actions for increasing recycling rates appropriate for authorities with high rates of population flux and high population densities are suggested, including targeted and carefully timed communications campaigns, especially for university students, and guidelines for new build properties. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Ghisellini2016b,
abstract = {In the last few years Circular Economy (CE) is receiving increasing attention worldwide as a way to overcome the current production and consumption model based on continuous growth and increasing resource throughput. By promoting the adoption of closing-the-loop production patterns within an economic system CE aims to increase the efficiency of resource use, with special focus on urban and industrial waste, to achieve a better balance and harmony between economy, environment and society. This study provides an extensive review of the literature of last two decades, with the purpose of grasping the main CE features and perspectives: origins, basic principles, advantages and disadvantages, modelling and implementation of CE at the different levels (micro, meso and macro) worldwide. Results evidence that CE origins are mainly rooted in ecological and environmental economics and industrial ecology. In China CE is promoted as a top-down national political objective while in other areas and countries as European Union, Japan and USA it is a tool to design bottom-up environmental and waste management policies. The ultimate goal of promoting CE is the decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth. The implementation of CE worldwide still seems in the early stages, mainly focused on recycle rather than reuse. Important results have been achieved in some activity sectors (e.g. in waste management, where large waste recycling rates are achieved in selected developed countries). CE implies the adoption of cleaner production patterns at company level, an increase of producers and consumers responsibility and awareness, the use of renewable technologies and materials (wherever possible) as well as the adoption of suitable, clear and stable policies and tools. The lesson learned from successful experiences is that the transition towards CE comes from the involvement of all actors of the society and their capacity to link and create suitable collaboration and exchange patterns. Success stories also point out the need for an economic return on investment, in order to provide suitable motivation to companies and investors. In summary, the CE transition has just started. Moreover, the interdisciplinary framework underpinning CE offers good prospects for gradual improvement of the present production and consumption models, no longer adequate because of their environmental load and social inequity, a clear indicator of resource use inefficiency.},

abstract = {Frugal innovation is often associated with (ecological and social) sustainability because it is characterized by minimizing the use of resources (raw material, production resources, energy, fuel, water, waste, financial resources), it is more affordable, and better accessible than conventional innovations. My paper contributes a comprehensive literature overview on the connection between frugal innovation and sustainability. I address the used definitions of frugal innovation and sustainability, and outline the potentials and threats of frugal innovation for sustainability. My research approach is a two-step procedure, consisting of a literature review according to Cooper (focusing on the steps of data collection and data evaluation) and a qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. For data collection and data evaluation, I searched various databases with selected keywords. The 14 identified texts were analyzed with a qualitative content analysis in the type of inductive category development. All texts examined describe a positive connection between frugal innovation and sustainability and/or potentials of frugal innovation for sustainability. Just under half of the authors outline negative connections between frugal innovation and sustainability and/or threats of frugal innovation for sustainability. Based on the results it can be noted, that frugal innovation is inherently socially and economically sustainable. In view of the empirical negations of the inherence of ecological sustainability in frugal innovation, I recommend the use of the term “ecological sustainable frugal innovation” for frugal innovation with a positive connection to ecological sustainability. Research implications and issues for future research relating to ecological sustainable frugal innovation, like voluntary simplicity, degrowth, (alternative to) planned obsolescence, and circular economy are presented.},

abstract = {Universities are central players and important economic actors in many regions, and many of them are, in general, nationally and internationally active in respect of matters related to sustainable development. But there is a paucity of research which examines their contributions towards sustainability efforts at the local level, i.e. in the places they are situated. This paper addresses this need, by reporting on a qualitative study deploying a Matrix, which allows an analysis and reporting of regional sustainable development initiatives of a set of 22 universities in industrialised and developing countries. Recommendations to enhance their role are provided, including the importance of pursuing partnerships and joint initiatives, understanding the need of local communities, and making their know-how more widely available. The scientific value of this research is related to the understanding of how the interaction between universities and local communities happens and by shedding light to this topic, it supports universities to improve their own actions. Its implications are two-fold: it demonstrates the potential of universities as local players and outlines the range of activities they may engage with, and which may allow them to act as pillars to local sustainability initiatives.},

abstract = {This contribution reviews the execution of an open source hardware (OSHW) project as part of the Master in Mechatronics Degree Programme at the University of Southern Denmark. There were a number of reasons that motivated us to carry out this project; educational, intellectual and research reasons. Open source projects provide unique opportunities for students to gain experience solving real-world problems. There was also a research consideration in pursuing an OSHW project. Three of the authors of this contribution are working towards a Master's Degree in Innovation and Business and wanted to carry out an OSHW project as a precursor to doing research work on the ‘Commercialization of OSHW Projects'. The choice of the project was all important and we choose to build a 3-D printer using information provided by the RepRap Open Source Community because this satisfied nearly all our specifications for an OSHW project. Our experiences in constructing a 3-D printer as well as documenting the areas where the open source information currently has deficiencies are documented here},

abstract = {Until recently, most manufacturing processes have been 'subtractive' in that matter is removed (e.g., scraped, dissolved, turned, machined) from a substance in order to produce the desired product. 3-D printing turns traditional manufacturing on its head in that it uses an 'additive' process. Similar to laser and inkjet printers, 3-D (three-dimensional) printers produce pieces by depositing, or adding, layers of material-plastic, polymer filaments, metals, and even foodstuffs-until the desired product is realized. This means that the creation and production of 'one-offs' is not only easy, it is also economically viable. 3-D printers are becoming ever more affordable, and it is not hard to envision them being as common in most homes in the near future as their two-dimensional counterparts are today. This article presents a 3-D printing primer for non-technical managers. It then considers the profound impact that 3-D printing will have on firms of all kinds as well as on individual consumers. In addition, it raises the substantial questions that 3-D printing will pose to policy makers from both intellectual property and ethical standpoints.},

We asked further about their needs and dreams for technical products, and their forecasts of converging industries. A fourth survey, fielded later to experts in technology forecasting and science policy, yielded assessments of the earlier survey results as well as the experts' own views on the advances, needs, and convergence questions. A combined analysis of the four surveys leads to this paper's portrait of the expected scientific and business environments 35 years hence, and a description of the gaps between expected developments in science, technology and business on the one hand, and market and social needs on the other hand. Years between 2018 and 2053 will bring significant benefits from the convergence of biomedicine and computer science. They will bring challenges and changes to the agriculture and education sectors. Surveyed experts believe many of the areas of greatest social need, including dealing with climate change, are those that businesses are least prepared to respond to.},

abstract = {This paper takes three global visions of world development to 2050 and quantifies their implications for sustainable progress employing the metrics of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDG outcomes are structured through the interconnectivities of the three ‘wedding cake' layers of ‘economy', ‘society' and ‘biosphere', as posited by the Stockholm Resilience Centre. The key policy contribution is to quantify the resulting SDG synergies and trade-offs, whilst also decomposing and calculating the part-worth of the market drivers which contribute to these outcomes. The paper employs a global economic simulation model that combines rational market behaviour with environmental constraints (MAGNET) and is further extended with an SDG metrics module. A ‘non-sustainable' world reveals trade-offs between economy and biosphere SDGs, with population growth of particular concern to a safe planetary operating space in the world's poorest regions. Sustainable visions could reduce natural resource pressures and emissions and meet energy requirements at potentially limited economic cost. Notwithstanding, these futures do not address income inequalities and potentially increase food security concerns for the most vulnerable members of society. Consequently, developed region led international cooperation and in-kind income transfers to developing countries, constitutes a necessary prerequisite to help remedy the SDG trade-offs exhibited within the more sustainable global pathways.},

abstract = {Commodity thermoplastics and thermoplastic composites are staples in Additive Manufacturing (AM). Their use is widespread and accounts for the largest volume of 3D printed materials. Accessible property ranges of current material formulations are limited, and thus there is high interest in extending AM to high-performance engineering polymers and nanocomposites that have yet to gain wide commercial acceptance in AM. Current applications of high-performance thermoplastic polymers are limited to adaptations from conventional plastics processing such as injection molding, thermoforming, extrusion, and others. Thermoplastic composites can be categorized into particle-, fiber-, and nanomaterial-based composites as well as polymer blends. The importance of these different composite systems to AM is discussed in this review. Also reviewed are trends in instrument development such as in-nozzle impregnation, dual print heads, and higher temperature FDM that improve printing of thermoplastic composites. An overview of newer types of AM techniques allowing higher filler loading for thermoplastic composites like liquid deposition modeling (LDM) sometimes known as direct ink writing (DIW) are discussed. Finally, a perspective is given on the important parameters and standards needed to make AM printed objects from polymer composites more effective in cost/performance ratio.},

abstract = {The United Nations together with various national and local actors have acknowledged the importance of sustainable development. However, sustainable development implementation is not straightforward and requires contribution by different actors. Universities have a role in influencing and contributing towards sustainable development. Also, some universities have committed to support sustainable development implementation. One of the instruments to implement sustainable development are policy frameworks, which exist at international, national and institutional level. Vertical policy integration is crucial to support effective implementation of sustainable development. Analysing vertical policy integration could provide information to help improve sustainable development implementation. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to improve understanding of sustainable development implementation in higher education by undertaking a multilevel (international, nationally, organisational) analysis of policy frameworks. Results suggested that policy frameworks include policy issues such as collaboration, partnership, education, outreach, teaching and learning, staff development, curriculum review, research, campus operations and policy that can support sustainable development implementation. However, these policy issues are not consistently integrated at all levels of policy frameworks. Achieving consistency could enhance sustainable development implementation in higher education institutions.},

abstract = {Plastics are inexpensive, lightweight and durable materials, which can readily be moulded into a variety of products that find use in a wide range of applications. As a consequence, the production of plastics has increased markedly over the last 60 years. However, current levels of their usage and disposal generate several environmental problems. Around 4 per cent of world oil and gas production, a non-renewable resource, is used as feedstock for plastics and a further 3-4{\%} is expended to provide energy for their manufacture. A major portion of plastic produced each year is used to make disposable items of packaging or other short-lived products that are discarded within a year of manufacture. These two observations alone indicate that our current use of plastics is not sustainable. In addition, because of the durability of the polymers involved, substantial quantities of discarded end-of-life plastics are accumulating as debris in landfills and in natural habitats worldwide. Recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce these impacts and represents one of the most dynamic areas in the plastics industry today. Recycling provides opportunities to reduce oil usage, carbon dioxide emissions and the quantities of waste requiring disposal. Here, we briefly set recycling into context against other waste-reduction strategies, namely reduction in material use through downgauging or product reuse, the use of alternative biodegradable materials and energy recovery as fuel. While plastics have been recycled since the 1970s, the quantities that are recycled vary geographically, according to plastic type and application. Recycling of packaging materials has seen rapid expansion over the last decades in a number of countries. Advances in technologies and systems for the collection, sorting and reprocessing of recyclable plastics are creating new opportunities for recycling, and with the combined actions of the public, industry and governments it may be possible to divert the majority of plastic waste from landfills to recycling over the next decades.},

This paper investigates two technology business incubators in China and the UK through a comparative lens and offers empirical evidence to support its theoretical argumentation. From a temporal perspective, we found that different types of stakeholders play different roles in deploying three distinctive mechanisms—namely, initiating, orchestrating and partaking—during the developmental trajectory involved in the launch and development of entrepreneurial ventures. Importantly, from a micro-foundational perspective, we highlight the agency-orientated activities championed by entrepreneurial organizations situated in global strategic partnership contexts.},

To reduce this amount, we should understand the predictors of consumers' food waste. We conducted a large mail survey in Switzerland to investigate which determinants explain the self-reported amount of food waste in households. Determinants were taken from the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), as well as personal norms, knowledge, household planning habits and the good provider identity. Self-reported amounts of food waste were assessed for 11 food groups. The TPB determinants, together with the good provider identity, explained the amount of food waste well. Moreover, different predictors appeared relevant for waste in different food categories. To reduce food waste in households, interventions should focus on increasing consumers' perceived behavioural control over food waste and persuading them that they can be a good provider without wasting food.},

Maturity curve is forecasted using the best-fitted growth curve method. Gompertz growth curve is better fitted than the logistic curve for many instances. Majority of the technologies follows introduction, growth, maturity and decline pattern. The life cycle pattern and growth rate of each technology is different. Growth pattern of mainframes and minicomputers is similar to the S-shaped curve.

abstract = {3D Printing is widely used in scientific researches and engineering applications, ranging from aerospace to biomedicine. However little is known about the mechanical properties of 3D printing materials. In order to promote the mechanical analysis and design of 3D printing structures, the ultimate tensile strength of FDM PLA materials with different printing angles were studied theoretically and experimentally. A theoretical model was firstly established to predict the ultimate tensile strength of FDM PLA materials based on transverse isotropic hypothesis, classical lamination theory and Hill-Tsai anisotropic yield criterion, and then verified by tensile experiments. Compared with previous models, this model provided two kinds of in-plane shear modulus calculation methods, so the calculation results were more reliable. The specimens, designed according to the current plastic-multipurpose test specimens standard ISO 527-2-2012, were printed in seven different angles (0 ∘ , 15 ∘ , 30 ∘ , 45 ∘ , 60 ∘ , 75 ∘ , 90 ∘ ) with three layer thicknesses (0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, 0.3 mm) for each angle. The relative residual sum of squares between theoretical data and experimental data were all close to zero, so the results that the theoretical model can accurately predict the ultimate tensile strength of FDM materials for all angles and thicknesses were confirmed. It was also found that the ultimate tensile strength decreased as the printing angle becomes smaller or the layer becomes thicker. This theoretical model and experimental method can also be applied to other 3D printing materials fabricated by FDM or SLA techniques.},

@misc{Finisdore2021,
abstract = {Mustajoki et al. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.101049 provided a valuable application of ecosystem services (ES) classification approaches to inform multi-criteria decision making analysis (MCDA) value trees. The exercise identified potential pitfalls of applying ES classification systems to MCDA and offered solutions by making adjustments to the value tree. The potential pitfalls included difficulty in narrowing down important ES, the lack of accounting for indirect benefits, and double counting. These pitfalls could also have been addressed, perhaps more efficiently, within the identification of ES before being placed into value trees. Broad use of this careful ES identification would improve their use in many decision making tools and applications. ES classification approaches have developed from simple ES categories presented by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and The Economics of Ecosystems {\&} Biodiversity (TEEB) to the present-day hierarchical classification systems of Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) and the National Ecosystem Services Classification System Plus (NESCS). The MA brought classification science to the ES field by defining the supporting, regulating, provisioning, and cultural ES categories. The MA also warned that "These categories overlap extensively, and the purpose is not to establish a taxonomy but rather to ensure that the analysis addresses the entire range of services" (MA 2003, p. 38 in Finisdore et al. 2020). The MA authors were aware that classification systems must be complete, mutually exclusive, consistent, relevant to users' needs, stable through time, comparable to other classification systems, flexible, and include a vocabulary and thesaurus (Finisdore et al., 2020). TEEB recognized some of the overlap among the MA categories and the risks of double counting it engenders, noting that ES differ from economic benefits. CICES built on this observation by seeking to eliminate ecological processes as ES, while developing the first hierarchy of ES. The hierarchy was enabled by the final ecosystem services (FES) concept. FES are the point where a product transitions from being predominately ecological to being predominately economic, and directly used or appreciated by humans (Boyd and Banzhaf, 2007). For example, consider that for fish to make it to market, a boat, fishing supplies, fuel, and labor are typically needed. The transition occurs with the application of manmade capital that allows the fish to be caught. The transition point is ultimately determined by who is using the product. To the fisher, fish available for harvest is the FES, whereas to a SCUBA diver, it is fish available for recreational viewing (Finisdore et al. 2020). FES allow CICES and NESCS to differentiate between ecological processes and economic benefits, and therefore reduce the chance of double counting. Using CICES or NESCS Plus to identify FES includes the identification of users or user groups of the ecological end product provided by the ecosystem (e.g., fish for fishers). The process of identifying the user group and the ecological end product simultaneously helps narrow the list of important FES for an analysis. For example, only in a follow-up exercise to the one described in Mustajoki et al. were the lack of berry pickers (user group) in the target peatlands identified (Saarikoski et al., 2019). Moreover, there are benefits to identifying less important FES to any one study, as it can inform future studies. Another advantage of careful ES identification is knowing which items are not FES. Peat extraction, for example, is not considered by most to be an ES because the regeneration time required to restore its ability to be used for recreation or berry picking is multigenerational. Mustajoki et al. recognizes this, but still identified peat extraction as an ES because of its importance to the study. Mustajoki et al. would likely have placed it into a separate branch of the MCDA value tree early on if peat extraction was identified consistently with the ES classification system. Similarly, CICES and NESCS Plus do not include indirect benefits in order to reduce double counting. A value tree, like the one described in Mustajoki et al., could have placed these indirect benefits in a separate branch from the start. The ubiquitous use of the terms 'provisioning,' 'regulating,' 'cultural', and 'supporting' in the ES literature over the last two decades demonstrates how the MA categories unified thinking and language. As the field has developed, the flexibility and iterations of classification systems have been identified as ideal means for not only codifying existing ES knowledge, but also for incorporating new learning and spreading it across the ES field. Furthering the application of ES requires careful use of the term 'ES classification systems' and better engagement with their custodians to keep them updated and to address novel applications.},

abstract = {In addition to the steps taken to ensure optimal efficiency in industry, significant effort has been directed towards the green and sustainable manufacturing practices. In this paper, we review conventional and state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies to provide insight into energy consumption at the processing level. In the review, collected energy data were summarized for three manufacturing categories: conventional bulk-forming, subtractive, and additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Additive processes, in particular, are strongly emphasized in the Advanced Manufacturing Initiatives proposed recently by the United States government. Currently, the specific energy consumption (SEC) of additive processes is estimated to be ∼100-fold higher than that of conventional bulk-forming processes, with subtractive processes showing intermediate values that varied over a wide range in terms of scale. Although SEC may vary with respect to the details, in general, the research showed a negative correlation with respect to the reciprocal logarithmic form of the productivity. In addition to the literature review presented, we performed case studies for the three manufacturing processes, to provide practical examples of energy consumption. Additionally, our results indicated that AM processes may require more extensive evaluation; i.e.; an assessment of the entire manufacturing cycle, for more accurate prediction of the subsequent environmental impact. {\textcopyright} 2014 Korean Society for Precision Engineering.},

A recent research report offers a candidate chemistry to fill the needs of a new process. Utilizing tandem catalytic cross-alkane metathesis (CAM) process, researchers have shown that polyethylenes can be degraded under mild reaction conditions using an iridium catalyst as outlined in the following scheme: Using a sequence of dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reactions conducted by two catalysts, the CAM process leads to waxes and liquid fuels as recycled products. The alkane dehydrogenation catalyst abstracts hydrogen from PE and a low molecular weight alkane to form a catalytic intermediate species (Ir-H 2) and an unsaturated intermediate. Olefin metathesis follows by employing a catalyst to combine the alkenes, which are then hydrogenated to products, and com-pletes the decomposition of the PE chain. The recycling of the reaction sequence leads to the formation of liquid fuels and dehydrogenation},

abstract = {The populations most susceptible to environmental degradation are often the populations that rely most on the natural world for sustenance. Within the many isolated islands that are part of rural Indonesia, many communities are dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods, but paradoxically members of these communities often engage in practices that destroy their natural resources. The current research uses survey methodology to investigate determinants of sustainable behavioral intentions of participants (N = 104) living in coastal communities in Sulawesi, Indonesia—specifically through the lens of an adapted theory of planned behavior model. Results showed that participants with stronger intentions to use nets and lines to fish had more negative attitudes to destructive fishing, a greater sense that their behavior and that of their community affects marine life, and greater belief that other villages are responsible for degrading reefs. Participants with stronger intentions to prevent their waste from going into the ocean had more negative attitudes to throwing waste in the ocean, greater perceptions of control over the behavior, and more positive perceptions of change in the health of the reefs. Although some of the findings align with theory and past research, some were unexpected, highlighting the importance of conducting research to identify motivators of sustainable practices in developing world, low resource communities.},

abstract = {The quest for sustainability is changing how chemical engineers conceptualise new processes. The task also becomes more complicated by economic and social uncertainties, local diversity of renewable resources and globalisation. These realities are changing the nature of process design problems and recent advancements have been able to incorporate the multidimensionality and multiscale boundaries by exploiting the power of mathematical methods, decision support frameworks and insight based methods. In doing so, two main trends for methods development can be distinguished, the ones considering expanded boundaries for design from the lowest molecular level to the process level, and the ones from process to the higher levels of value chains, ecosystems and the planet. However, a truly integrated framework that captures the full range of scales and interactions from molecular to planetary levels is yet to be developed to be able to find superior designs that perhaps we had never thought of before.},

Fab Labs encourage open and free knowledge-sharing among ‘experts' and the general public. Claims are being made about community-based digital fabrication workshops transforming practices of design, innovation, production and consumption, while describing positive impacts on the environment and social goals. Research that examines such claims is sparse. This paper explores realities of using digital fabrication technologies within a Fab Lab. It draws on a case study that describes practical outcomes of a design workshop in which a multidisciplinary team engaged in issues of sustainable design and processes of co-creation to design and fabricate a prototype. This experience provides insight into the impact of digital fabrication technologies within a sustainable and co-creational design context and critical reflections are presented.},

abstract = {A linear economy approach results in many environmental challenges: resources become depleted and end up as waste and emissions. One of the key strategies to overcome these problems is using waste as a resource, i.e. evolving toward a circular economy. To monitor this transition, suitable indicators are needed that focus on sustainability issues whilst taking into account the technical reality. In this paper, we develop such an indicator to quantify the circular economy performance of different plastic waste treatment options. This indicator is based on the technical quality of the plastic waste stream and evaluates resource consumption by using the Cumulative Exergy Extraction from the Natural Environment (CEENE) method. To illustrate the use of this new indicator, it was applied in a case study on post-industrial plastic waste treatment. The results show that the indicator can be a very useful approach to guide waste streams towards their optimal valorization option, based on quality of the waste flow and the environmental benefit of the different options.},

abstract = {In the recent years, the whole world is facing a serious problem in handling nylon-6 wastes of various societies like: fibres/textile, household, carpets, tires, military supplies, etc. Ordinary recycling process of such wastes is costlier process and also omits its major mechanical properties. In the present research work, nylon-6 waste (collected from local plastic based industry) has been recycled, through extrusion process, in the form of fused deposition modelling (FDM) feedstock filament. This alternatively developed FDM filament has been successfully used to fabricate sacrificial patterns for investment casting process (ICP). The process was started with investigating the melt flow index (MFI) of collected nylon-6 waste which was matched with the commercial FDM filament through reinforcement. Finally, single screw extruder of has been used for the development of FDM filament proportion with a mixture of 60{\%} nylon-6, 30{\%} Al and 30{\%} Al2O3 (by wt.). The resulting FDM patterns have been used in ICP for development of aluminum matrix composite (AMC). Taguchi L9 was used to investigate the affect of process parameters (volume of pattern, density of pattern and number of IC coatings) on dimensional accuracy of AMC developed. Apart from suggesting an alternative method for management and recycling of nylon-6 waste, the present research work also described a new approach for the development of AMC with tailor made properties.},

abstract = {Despite the increasing awareness of business and academic research toward creative thinking, the investigation of its uptake by industry is still limited. Supplier engagement attracts considerable interest as a means to improve green innovation. Previous research studies in an inter-firm relationship have addressed the impact of green innovation on sustainability performance. While some studies have concluded that creative thinking can lead to sustainable performance outcomes, others have questioned the positive influence of creative thinking on innovation. This study takes a top-up perspective on ways to stimulate creative thinking with supplier engagement. Relying on the social capital theory and its wider contextualization in relation with the creativity, the authors argue that supplier engagement levers for driving green innovation and facilitates the sustainable development. We aim to advance understanding of the role of creativity, along with how and why creativity is important for the development of green innovation practices for a sustainable future. This study provides a more finegrained perspective by developing a theoretical model. Contributions from this study include research propositions to help explain and predict why and how firm resources become more important when combined with the creative thinking. Creative thinking is a fast-growing topic among the global community for the way that it enables sustainable development initiatives. Creativity boosts environmental, social and economic performance by enabling the development of green products and processes. Creative thinking has become an important tool driving green innovation within organizations and plays a critical role in enhancing sustainability performance. This study provides novel insights into how to organize creative abilities for sustainable development and provide actionable research direction and policy implications for both practitioners and academicians.},

abstract = {The scholars of sustainable development and education mostly believe that universities have an underlying role in explaining the movement of human societies towards sustainable development; but universities can play such a role, only if they themselves are sustainable as well. However, the subjects on sustainable development in Iran's higher education are still in their early stages and face many challenges. Some of these challenges are associated with the lack of engagement of university operators, especially students, in sustainability activities. Value Co-creation process in academic environments might be very effective in overcoming these challenges. Moreover, few studies have been conducted yet on what the relationship between Value Co-creation and sustainability level is and revealing the effective key factors in academic environments. In addition, the causal relationships between the factors influencing Value Co-creation in academic environments have not been taken into consideration by researchers. The overall aim of this study is to explore the effective factors in the engagement of universities and students in Value Co-creation process and to introduce a model for improving the level of Value Co-creation in academic environments. For this purpose, Mixed Method within a sequential-explanatory design was used. The results obtained from the content analysis showed that a total of eight factors affect the students' engagement in Value Co-creation process. The factors were classified into two general categories: (1) university-related factors (including university management support for sustainability-oriented activities, sustainability-oriented education, ICT infrastructures, and teaching quality of instructors); and (2) students-related factors (including Sustainability-oriented values, social capital, perceived self-efficacy, and trust in faculty members). The Structural Equation Model (SEM) of the study indicated that sustainability-oriented values, university management support for sustainability-oriented activities, trust in faculty members, social capital, and perceived self-efficacy have a direct and significant impact on the Value Co-creation process in the studied universities. There was also a positive and significant relationship between the engagement of students in Value Co-creation process and university sustainability.},

abstract = {In this study, involving additive manufacturing (AM) using electron beam melting (EBM), we have examined build defects which result from beam tripping, porosities (including unmelted or unsintered zones) due to excursions from optimal build parameters (especially variations in melt scan beam current and scan speed), and gas bubbles trapped in atomized Ti-6Al-4V starting powder as well as recycled powder, and retained in the build. At optimized build conditions we have also examined microstructure-mechanical property (hardness, tensile strength, and elongation) variations for multiple rake building and multiple melt scans using optical metallography and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). These build variances cause cooling rate variances which promote $\alpha$-phase growth and variations in dislocation density, as well as $\alpha$-to-$\alpha$′ (martensite) phase changes, all of which produce some degree of mechanical property variations. These features (especially $\alpha$-to-$\alpha$' phase changes) are notable on comparing solid builds in comparison with a variety of mesh arrays where strut dimension and build-element complexities alter the cooling rates in a significant way. We illustrate these microstructure variations with corresponding variations in microindentation hardness measurements made directly on fine mesh (strut) structures. Finally, we have examined Ti-6Al-4V powder chemistries and solid build chemistries which for single-pass melt scans at optimized build conditions are shown to be relatively constant up to 40 cycles of powder reuse with the exception of Al content which was reduced by 10 to 15{\%} in solid builds at optimized conditions. However, Al loss in solid builds approached 25{\%} for multiple (2 and 3) melt scans, while no changes in Ar gas-bubble density were observed with changes in $\alpha$-phase (grain) width which increased from 3 $\mu$m for a single melt scan to 4.5 and 6 $\mu$m for 2 and 3 melt scans, respectively. Corresponding Rockwell C-scale (HRC) hardness varied from 37, 36, and 35, respectively; with ultimate tensile strengths exceeding 1.2 GPa at elongations of 12{\%} or higher for this melt scan sequence.},

abstract = {The circular economy (CE) aims to radically improve resource efficiency by eliminating the concept of waste and leading to a shift away from the linear take-make-waste model. In a CE, resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a biocycle (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early studies indicate that 3D printing (3DP) holds substantial promise for sustainability and the creation of a CE, there is no guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty regarding whether the current trajectory of 3DP adoption is creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3DP reaches a critical inflection point in which negative practices become entrenched. This paper, authored by both academic and industry experts, proposes a research agenda to determine enablers and barriers for 3DP to achieve a CE. We explore the two following overarching questions to discover what specific issues they entail: (1) How can a more distributed manufacturing system based on 3DP create a circular economy of closed-loop material flows? (2) What are the barriers to a circular 3D printing economy? We specifically examine six areas-design, supply chains, information flows, entrepreneurship, business models and education-with the aim of formulating a research agenda to enable 3DP to reach its full potential for a CE.},

These cost barriers can be surmounted by eliminating the entire process of fusing filament by three-dimensional (3-D) printing products directly from polymer granules. Fused granular fabrication (FGF) (or fused particle fabrication (FPF)) is being held back in part by the accessibility of low-cost pelletizers and choppers. An open-source 3-D printable invention disclosed here allows for precisely controlled pelletizing of both single thermopolymers as well as composites for 3-D printing. The system is designed, built, and tested for its ability to provide high-tolerance thermopolymer pellets with a number of sizes capable of being used in an FGF printer. In addition, the chopping pelletizer is tested for its ability to chop multi-materials simultaneously for color mixing and composite fabrication as well as precise fractional measuring back to filament. The US{\$}185 open-source 3-D printable pelletizer chopper system was successfully fabricated and has a 0.5 kg/h throughput with one motor, and 1.0 kg/h throughput with two motors using only 0.24 kWh/kg during the chopping process. Pellets were successfully printed directly via FGF as well as indirectly after being converted into high-tolerance filament in a recyclebot.},

abstract = {The goal of this research is to develop a costing framework and explore opportunities for fabricating components using additive manufacturing (AM) and machining approaches. The examples target plastic machining, and the fused deposition modeling AM process, but the general model structure is applicable for other AM processes as process knowledge is developed. The question "when is machining more cost-effective than AM" has not been comprehensively addressed. The purpose of this work is to develop a costing framework to provide insight on whether to use machining or AM. An estimation model which considers the process planning, setup, and fabrication time-cost elements is developed in a structured manner. This is challenging due to the machining process planning complexity, the decision-making, and the skill set required, especially for complex surface finish machining. This framework can be readily adapted to suit specific environments. The estimation time models are linked to a cost model, and comparisons are drawn, based on the form complexity and manufacturing quantity. An effective combination of AM and machining technologies could bring about a new hybrid manufacturing approach that meets the requirements of the next generation of production systems, especially for short-run production. A cost-benefit analysis is performed to illustrate solution approaches for designing additive, subtractive, or hybrid operation sets for a variety of components to highlight the merits of the presented approach. Exploring a larger solution space of processing options and their processing time and costs will allow designers to generate more cost-competitive solutions.},

abstract = {The convergence of multi-disciplinary knowledge may spur emerging technologies. It is important to understand this convergence process that helps to identify these emergent technologies; however, relevant research remains sparse. Therefore, this study aims to develop a novel framework to reveal the convergence process of scientific knowledge. This novel framework integrates the machine-learning topology clustering and visualization methods, and analyzes paper citation networks. This study selects the biological–informatics domain (bioinformatics) to conduct the empirical analysis. This paper finds two major stages throughout the convergence process: the fast-changing incubation stage and the stabilized development stage. In the incubation stage, the interactions between the biology and informatics knowledge domains becomes increasingly intensive, while emergent technology is yet to form; in the stable development stage, the emergent technology starts to form as a core cluster, and based on which it grows amid stabilized knowledge interactions between the original two domains. The revelation of this convergence process contributes to the formation theory of emerging technologies that are inter-disciplinary, and is of great interest to researchers, policy makers, and industrialists.},

abstract = {End-of-life electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) has recently received attention as a secondary source of metals. This study examined characteristics of end-of-life EEE as secondary metal resources to consider efficient collection and metal recovery systems according to the specific metals and types of EEE. We constructed an analogy between natural resource development and metal recovery from end-of-life EEE and found that metal content and total annual amount of metal contained in each type of end-of-life EEE should be considered in secondary resource development, as well as the collectability of the end-of-life products. We then categorized 21 EEE types into five groups and discussed their potential as secondary metal resources. Refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, and CRT TVs were evaluated as the most important sources of common metals, and personal computers, mobile phones, and video games were evaluated as the most important sources of precious metals. Several types of small digital equipment were also identified as important sources of precious metals; however, mid-size information and communication technology (ICT) equipment (e.g., printers and fax machines) and audio/video equipment were shown to be more important as a source of a variety of less common metals. The physical collectability of each type of EEE was roughly characterized by unit size and number of end-of-life products generated annually. Current collection systems in Japan were examined and potentially appropriate collection methods were suggested for equipment types that currently have no specific collection systems in Japan, particularly for video games, notebook computers, and mid-size ICT and audio/video equipment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {3D printing has received lots of attention due to its limitless potential and advantages in comparison to traditional manufacturing processes. This study focuses on the most popular type of home 3D printers, namely fused filament fabrication (FFF) printers, which use plastic filaments as the feedstock. The rather high material cost and large amount of plastic waste generated by FFF 3D printers have driven the need for plastic filaments produced from recycled plastic waste. This study evaluates, in terms of physical characterization, the feasibility of using recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE), one of the most commonly used plastics, as the feedstock for 3D printers, in comparison with the common acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic pellets. In-house extrusion using recycled HDPE pellets and flakes is possible. The diameter consistency and extrusion rate results, along with other physical characterization results, including differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and water absorption, suggest that making filaments from recycled HDPE pellets is a viable option, as the obtained filament has favorable water rejection and comparable extrusion rate and thermal stability. Existing methods for overcoming the warping and adhesion problems in 3D printing with HDPE were also reviewed. In order to increase the market competitiveness of waste-derived filaments, optimization of the extrusion process, studies on the mechanical and aging properties, and development of a standard characterization methodology and database are crucial.},

While there is a large amount of research on organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), interorganizational citizenship behavior (ICB) has received less attention. This study examines a dense, localized cluster of private, public, and non-profit organizations. Seven dimensions characterize ICB during the different phases of the innovation process. These ICBs reflect 16 interorganizational practices that generate absorptive capacity. Seven of these practices occur during the ideation phase, five during the invention phase, and four during the exploitation phase. Cooperation and collaboration precede or underlie ICB. This study shows that spatial proximity is insufficient for enhancing innovation activities in industrial agglomerations and that ICB, collaboration, and cooperation are necessary. Therefore, these findings contribute to knowledge on the theory of innovation management and economic geography.},

abstract = {The transition towards Sustainable Product-Service Systems (SPSS) is not an easy journey. The literature indicates several difficulties in obtaining success in the development of SPSS offers. These hardships indicate the need for well-structured methods supporting the systematic generation of sustainable innovations and solving contradictions during the stages of the servitization process. The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) is worldwide recognized by its potential to systematically solve contradictions and generate innovations. However, the research framework available and its application into SPSS domain{\textperiodcentered} are still very limited. Thus, to address this gap, this paper aims to explore the contributions and challenges of the adoption of TRIZ in the development of SPSSs. A systematic literature review of the foundations and advances in this topic was conducted. The primary results indicate the main contributions from TRIZ to SPSS development, the types of eco-innovations resulting, the artifacts (e.g. models, methods, proposition or instantiation) that applied TRIZ towards SPSS and the most frequent category of PSS resulting according to TRIZ. Findings suggest that the systematic innovation proposed by TRIZ has great potential to enable the development of systematic SPSS offers. Synergies between TRIZ and the sustainable strategies of Cleaner Production also were mapped. Finally, our study proposes a research agenda and indicate the main challenges to apply the TRIZ in SPSS models. A new concept emerges in servitization field: the Systematic and Sustainable Product-Service Systems (SSPSS).},

Although these labs were originally established by scientists and biologists, they now include civil society, creating a mix and match between experts and non-experts. This group also includes another category of nascent entrepreneurs known as disadvantaged DIYers (DDIYers) who are making the most of these spaces. DDIYers encompass a different range of people such as immigrants, women, and the disabled. The latter calls for a new wave of research focused on DDIYers who are affected by chronic disease; these people motivated the present study that examined a sample of 27 DDIYers who created their own business after being diagnosed with cancer. The following will investigate their motivations. It will be seen that DDIYers are driven by external motivations oriented towards the desire to fulfill unmet needs; existential motivations oriented towards finding meaning in and control over one's life; as well as the aim of having an ideal profession and sharing a common project. With this in mind, policymakers and research institutions are encouraged to facilitate the establishment of DIY labs and the sharing of resources and knowledge.},

In this system the level of garbage in the bin can be known by the use of sensors. Each dustbin has a unique ID. If the garbage in the bin reaches the threshold level, the garbage collectors are given information based on which they can collect the garbage. In case the dustbins reach threshold level, user will not be able to access the bin. In order to avoid the decaying smell around the bin the harmless chemical sprinklers are used. Further, the garbage is segregated into bio degradable and non-biodegradable wet and dry waste using a conveyor belt. Internally electric oven burns the dry waste and the ashes are used for certain applications such as in cleaning the pond and in preventing the growth of algae in the pond water. The wet wastes are made to decompose and it acts as a fertilizer to the fields. The plastic wastes collected are used in building plastic tar roads},

abstract = {Waste sorting is essential to address the current predicament of waste management. Though it is important, insufficient attention has been paid to explore residents' waste sorting intention and behavior and understand its formation process. To narrow the research gap, this research built a theoretical research model by adding personal moral norms and waste sorting knowledge into the theory of planned behavior to explicate residents' waste sorting intention and behavior formation process. Meanwhile, given the discrepancy between waste sorting intention and actual behavior, this research also explored the effect of external conditions, such as incentive measures, on this discrepancy. Based on survey data from 397 Chinese residents, this research found that attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, personal moral norms and waste sorting knowledge were directly and significantly related to residents' waste sorting intention. Waste sorting knowledge also had an indirect influence on residents' waste sorting intention through attitudes and perceived behavioral control. Additionally, this research corroborated the discrepancy between waste sorting intention and behavior, and suggested that the link between intention and behavior was contingent on incentive measures. Incentive measures strengthened the effect of intention on behavior. This research is useful for understanding residents' waste sorting intention and behavior and valuable for encouraging residents to sort waste in their daily lives.},

abstract = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM), also known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is a popular additive manufacturing technique suitable for producing 3D shapes using thermoplastic materials. The majority of companies that design and test 3D printing machines work with thermoplastic acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) filaments. It is, however, crucial to utilize different types of filaments for a broader range of applications with different mechanical property requirements. Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are smart materials that react to an applied stimulus in order to recover large strains. MEAM techniques may be used for the production of SMP-based parts, allowing for smart structures to be created in a wide variety of geometries. In this work, a commercial 3D-printer was used to produce 3D printed polyurethane-based SMP specimens. An annealing heat treatment was applied to some of the specimens. Mechanical and thermomechanical testing was conducted to study the effects of testing temperatures and annealing heat treatments on the tensile and shape memory properties of the samples. 3D printing was shown to be a suitable technique for producing SMP parts capable of retaining good shape memory characteristics. Different annealing heat treatments and test temperatures were found to have considerable effects on the SMP specimen properties. In particular, annealing the specimens at 85. °C for 2. h helped to improve the rate of shape recovery and the consistency of mechanical test results.},

abstract = {This article outlines the objectives, activities, and achievements of using intuitive logics scenarios to improve strategic decision-making in situations of discontinuity. Pierre Wack's work at Royal Dutch/Shell illustrates the use of exploratory, reframing, and decision scenarios to change the mental models of decision-makers in advance of the 1973 oil crisis. Thomas S. Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions offers a promising theoretical account of paradigm shifts in science, but its application is limited by the ambiguity of the concept of paradigm. Margaret Masterman's distinction of three senses of paradigm – introduced as construct paradigm, worldview paradigm, and action paradigm – clarifies and extends these accounts to support a preliminary framework and systematic approach. Overall, this investigation expands our understanding of strategic decision-making as guided not only by analytic achievements and developmental investigations but also by discontinuous breaks that can be explored and addressed using scenario methodology. Section 1 provides an introduction and literature review. Section 2 examines the scenarios developed at Royal Dutch/Shell. Section 3 summarizes Kuhn's new image of science, clarified by Masterman's three senses of paradigm in Section 4. Section 5 presents implications for scenario methodology, followed by conclusions and areas for research in Section 6.},

However, sustaining an innovation lab is a challenging task that requires more than well-meant intentions. Although this issue has been of interest to scholars for some time now, little is known about how innovation labs are managed or the main factors influencing their adaptation and evolution. Building on an existing framework, this article focuses on a case study of the ViveLab Bogot{\'{a}}, an innovation lab in the Colombian public sector. The results reveal that having a clear and shared strategic intent, effective governance mechanisms, a defined financial model, continuous knowledge generation and a community-based approach, are factors that may enable or limit an innovation lab to experience a sustainable evolution. Finally, reflections are also shared on the use of the selected framework and possible points for improvement.},

abstract = {Plastic recycling is a legal requirement and can yield environmental benefits. In the Netherlands, there is a complex network of various collection methods, separation centers, sorting centers and reprocessors. The first step of the recycling system, separating plastics from other waste, can occur within households (source-separation) or in separation centers (post-separation), making a difference in collection channel choice and technology requirements. The purpose of this paper is to provide decision support on choosing the most suitable combination of separation methods in the Netherlands. Decision support is given through optimized reverse logistics network design which makes the overall recycling system more efficient and sustainable, while taking into account the interests of various stakeholders (municipalities, households, etc.). A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which minimizes both transportation cost and environmental impact, is used in this network design. The research follows the approach of scenario study; the baseline scenario is the current situation and other scenarios are designed with various strategic alternatives. Modeling is conducted by using a graphical optimi- zation tool IBM LogicNet Plus 7.1. Comparing these scenarios, the results show that the current network settings of the baseline situation is efficient in logistics terms but has a potential to adapt to strategic changes, depending on the assumptions regarding availability of the required processing facilities to treat plastic waste. In some of the tested scenarios, a separate collection channel for Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottles is cost efficient and saves carbon emission. Although the figures differ depending on the separation method choices of municipalities, our modeling result of all the tested scenarios shows a saving of more than 25 {\%} carbon emission compared to the current network.},

abstract = {The Ecosystem Services (ES) concept highlights the varied contributions the environment provides to humans and there are a wide range of methods/tools available to assess ES. However, in real-world decision contexts a single tool is rarely sufficient and methods must be combined to meet practitioner needs. Here, results from the OpenNESS project are presented to illustrate the methods selected to meet the needs of 24 real-world case studies and better understand why and how methods are combined to meet practical needs. Results showed that within the cases methods were combined to: i) address a range of ES; ii) assess both supply and demand of ES; iii) assess a range of value types; iv) reach different stake-holder groups v) cover weaknesses in other methods used and vi) to meet specific decision context needs. Methods were linked in a variety of ways: i) as input-output chains of methods; ii) through learning; iii) through method development and iv) through comparison/triangulation of results. The paper synthesises these case study-based experiences to provide insight to others working in practical contexts as to where, and in what contexts, different methods can be combined and how this can add value to case study analyses.},

abstract = {The Triple Helix innovation model focuses on university-industry-government relations. The Quadruple Helix embeds the Triple Helix by adding as a fourth helix the ‘media-based and culture-based public' and ‘civil society'. The Quintuple Helix innovation model is even broader and more comprehensive by contextualizing the Quadruple Helix and by additionally adding the helix (and perspective) of the ‘natural environments of society'. The Triple Helix acknowledges explicitly the importance of higher education for innovation. However, in one line of interpretation it could be argued that the Triple Helix places the emphasis on knowledge production and innovation in the economy so it is compatible with the knowledge economy. The Quadruple Helix already encourages the perspective of the knowledge society, and of knowledge democracy for knowledge production and innovation. In a Quadruple Helix understanding, the sustainable development of a knowledge economy requires a coevolution with the knowledge society. The Quintuple Helix stresses the necessary socioecological transition of society and economy in the twenty-first century; therefore, the Quintuple Helix is ecologically sensitive. Within the framework of the Quintuple Helix innovation model, the natural environments of society and the economy also should be seen as drivers for knowledge production and innovation, therefore defining opportunities for the knowledge economy. The European Commission in 2009 identified the socioecological transition as a major challenge for the future roadmap of development. The Quintuple Helix supports here the formation of a win-win situation between ecology, knowledge and innovation, creating synergies between economy, society, and democracy. Global warming represents an area of ecological concern, to which the Quintuple Helix innovation model can be applied with greater potential.},

The typology is based on interviews with the participants of 26 living labs in Finland, Sweden, Spain, and South Africa. Companies can benefit from knowing the characteristics of each type of liv- ing lab; this knowledge will help them to identify which actor drives the innovation, to anti- cipate likely outcomes, and to decide what kind of role they should play while "living labbing". Living labs are networks that can help them create innovations that have a super- ior match with user needs and can be upscaled promptly to the global market.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag London. Development of decentralized solutions for managing individual products in manufacturing and postmanufacturing applications makes it possible to embed automation in the product flow, which is more efficient compared to the conventional approach based on automating individual unit processes. The decentralized approach can be enabled using manufacturing objects that are capable of negotiating with their environment, observing it, making decisions according to these observations, and sharing information on their status and needs. For these purposes, automatic identification (auto-ID) technology is required. Automatic identification involves techniques for automatically identifying things by using tokens with individual codes, collecting information on them, and transferring that information automatically into computer systems. In general, not only techniques such as barcode, optical character recognition (OCR), and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) are associated with auto-ID but also other techniques that are less used in manufacturing can be highlighted. The present study seeks to map the existing techniques for automatic identification of objects and to determine their most potential targets of use in manufacturing.},

abstract = {Circular economy is increasingly recognized as a better alternative to the dominant linear (take, make, and dispose)economic model. Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM), which integrates the philosophy of the circular economy into supply chain management, offers a new and compelling perspective to the supply chain sustainability domain. Consequently, there is increasing research interest. However, a review of the extant literature shows that a comprehensive integrated view of CSCM is still absent in the extant literature. This prohibits a clear distinction compared to other supply chain sustainability concepts and hinders further progress of the field. In response, this research first classifies various terminologies related to supply chain sustainability and conceptualizes a unifying definition of CSCM. Using this definition as a base, it then conducts a structured literature review of 261 research articles on the current state of CSCM research. Based on the review results, the researchers call for further studies in the following directions that are important but received little or no attention: design for circularity, procurement and CSCM, biodegradable packaging, circular supply chain collaboration and coordination, drivers and barriers of CSCM, circular consumption, product liabilities and producer's responsibility, and technologies and CSCM.},

abstract = {Fused particle fabrication (FPF) (or fused granular fabrication (FGF)) has potential for increasing recycled polymers in 3-D printing. Here, the open source Gigabot X is used to develop a new method to optimize FPF/FGF for recycled materials. Virgin polylactic acid (PLA) pellets and prints were analyzed and were then compared to four recycled polymers including the two most popular printing materials (PLA and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)) as well as the two most common waste plastics (polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP)). The size characteristics of the various materials were quantified using digital image processing. Then, power and nozzle velocity matrices were used to optimize the print speed, and a print test was used to maximize the output for a two-temperature stage extruder for a given polymer feedstock. ASTM type 4 tensile tests were used to determine the mechanical properties of each plastic when they were printed with a particle drive extruder system and were compared with filament printing. The results showed that the Gigabot X can print materials 6.5× to 13× faster than conventional printers depending on the material, with no significant reduction in the mechanical properties. It was concluded that the Gigabot X and similar FPF/FGF printers can utilize a wide range of recycled polymer materials with minimal post processing.},

abstract = {Although the trend in manufacturing has been towards centralization to leverage economies of scale, the recent rapid technical development of open-source 3-D printers enables low-cost distributed bespoke production. This paper explores the potential advantages of a distributed manufacturing model of high-value products by investigating the application of 3-D printing to self-refraction eyeglasses. A series of parametric 3-D printable designs is developed, fabricated and tested to overcome limitations identified with mass-manufactured self-correcting eyeglasses designed for the developing world's poor. By utilizing 3-D printable self-adjustable glasses, communities not only gain access to far more diversity in product design, as the glasses can be customized for the individual, but 3-D printing also offers the potential for significant cost reductions. The results show that distributed manufacturing with open-source 3-D printing can empower developing world communities through the ability to print less expensive and customized self-adjusting eyeglasses. This offers the potential to displace both centrally manufactured conventional and self-adjusting glasses while completely eliminating the costs of the conventional optics correction experience, including those of highly-trained optometrists and ophthalmologists and their associated equipment. Although, this study only analyzed a single product, it is clear that other products would benefit from the same approach in isolated regions of the developing world.},

abstract = {Different from other 3D printing techniques such as selective laser sintering (SLS), stereolithography (SLA), three-dimensional printing (3DP), and laminated object manufacturing (LOM), the fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology is widely used in aerospace, automobile making, bio-medicals, smart home, stationery and training aids, and creative gifts for its easy use, simple operation, and low cost. The polylactic acid (PLA) is a material most extensively applied in FDM technology for its low melting point, non-poison, non-irritation, and sound biocompatibility. The FDM 3D-printed PLA parts are a research hotspot in the 3D printing field. This paper is intended to sum up the latest research results and achievements made in recent years in the interface bonding property, mechanical properties, and shape precision promotion of FDM 3D-printed PLA parts as well as the functional expansion of the PLA parts based on vast domestic and overseas literature. The literature research collection focuses on the following two aspects: one is the macroscopic technical research on the optimal settings of key technological parameters; the other one is the PLA modification research on improvement of cross-linking state and crystallinity of PLA molecular chains, carbon reinforced phase modification of PLA, and PLA functional compound modification. The researches in the two aspects are of importance in improving whole properties, enhancing functional applications, and expanding and enriching the applications of FDM 3D-printed PLA parts. This paper is expected to give some helps and references to the researchers who are specializing in the 3D printing field.},

abstract = {Laser Sintering is an Additive Manufacturing technique increasingly used to produce functional parts, with polyamide-12 (PA12) being by far the most processed material. It is common practice in industry to process a mix of recycled and virgin PA12 powder; however it is not yet fully understood how the Laser Sintering process parameters influence the microstructural composition for this mixture, namely the degree of crystallinity, the porosity characteristics and the distribution of the pores within the sintered parts. In this work X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is used to investigate the porosity of tensile bars printed flatwise using a 50/50 mix of used and virgin PA12 processed with different Laser Sintering energy densities (EDs). Analysis of the pores characteristics and image processing of the CT-slices parallel to the building platform provide insights into the link between Laser Sintering process parameters, pores formation and their arrangement into the sintered polymer for different energy density levels. This information combined with the crystallinity values measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry, gives a complete picture of the microstructure of the sintered material and its link with the resulting tensile properties.},

abstract = {Polymer recycling is a way to reduce environmental impacts of accumulation of polymeric waste materials. However, low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants mainly to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight-polymers in conventional centralized recycling plants. As the democratization of open-source 3D printers is going forward thanks to initiatives such as FabLab environments, there is a growing interest on how to use this technology to improve the efficiency of use of raw materials. Studies have been proposed in order to recycle waste polymer into open-source 3D printer feedstock. The recycling of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) issued from bottles of used milk jugs through use of an open-source filament fabricator system called RecycleBot has been evaluated. In this study, we propose an evaluation of the mechanical recyclability of Polylactic Acid (PLA), material widely used in the open-source 3D printing context, in order to establish the viability of this recycled material to be used in the open-source 3D printers. The degradation of the material's mechanical and rheological properties after a number of cycles of multiple extrusion and printing processes is evaluated. The characterization of recycled raw materials for open-source 3D printing has implications not only to reduce the environmental impact of polymers waste, but also it will allow us to understand the technical requirements and challenges for development of open-source filament recycle machine/process. The coupling of open-source 3D printers and filament extruders can offer the bases of a new distributed polymer recycling paradigm, which reverses the traditional paradigm of centralizing recycling of polymers where is often uneconomic and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. Moreover, this characterization also will allow the exploration of new source of materials and new composite materials for open-source 3D printing, in order to improve the quality of products made by this technology.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) was developed initially as a technique for rapid prototyping, to visualize, test and authenticate a design, before end-user production of the design. In recent years, Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique Fused Deposition modeling (FDM), has developed to become a rapid manufacturing technique because of the ability to produce complex parts layer-by-layer in lesser production cycle time than as compared to conventional machining processes. FDM also offers the advantage of the lowest cost because of no tooling requirements. Despite these advantages, building parts by utilizing FDM for end-use is still a demanding endeavor. This is because FDM has multiple processing parameters, which affect the part quality, mechanical properties, build time and dimensional accuracy. These FDM processing parameters include air gap, build orientation, infill percentage, raster angle, layer thickness, etc. Depending upon the application, for which the part is manufactured, careful selection of these process parameters needs to be done. For a specific output requirement, some of the process parameters are significant than the rest, these significant process parameters need to be identified and optimized. Due to this, researchers have explored and utilized various experimental or statistical Design of Experiment (DOE) techniques for optimizing the FDM process parameters to improve the mechanical properties or part quality or both. Some of these DOE techniques include the Taguchi method, Genetic algorithm (GA), gray relational, Response surface method (RSM), fractional factorial, Artificial Neural networks (ANN), Fuzzy logic, ANOVA, etc. This article aims at reviewing the current research on the statistical and experimental design techniques for different applications or output responses such as enhancing mechanical properties, build time, part quality, etc.},

abstract = {Nowadays, increasingly complex sets of indicators are used to compare and diagnose municipal solid waste management (MSWM). These sets incorporate new priorities regarding sustainability and focus on measuring the progress to zero waste. Nevertheless, in developing countries, where MSWM is still striving to protect health from the potential impacts of waste, the MSWM information available is scarce and of low quality. This work proposes a basic set of indicators for analyzing technical aspects of street cleaning, waste collection and disposal in such contexts. Based on the assessment of 66 Mexican municipalities, ten indicators were identified that can be calculated with the information available. For each indicator, reference values were established, and their performance was evaluated by means of a traffic light system. In addition, a method that allows the quality of the information to be classified into four levels according to the data source, its uncertainty, the temporal coverage, and its spatial coverage was applied. The results obtained revealed an incipient implementation of MSWM and highlighted the need to increase the coverage of the collection services and to improve the conditions of the disposal sites in most of the municipalities that were studied. The proposed set of indicators can be used as a starting point to systematize the monitoring and detection of areas of improvement in the MSWM of the municipalities studied, as well as in other systems in similar contexts.},

The study reveals how these two academic fields evolved to become distinct fields with little interaction despite shared environmental sustainability objectives. In assessing more than 56,000 publications, we identified just 91 LCA studies that integrate biotic ecosystem services in a meaningful way. We further classified these papers based on an ecosystem service standardization system-the Common International Classification for Ecosystem Services (CICES)-and the use of LCA midpoints and endpoints. LCA research has focused on a relatively small number of regulation and maintenance ecosystem services (especially carbon balance), with far less emphasis on provisioning services. Research on cultural services is especially scarce. Land use is a particularly promising area for integrative ecosystem services-LCA research but will require more sophisticated accounting of geographic and temporal variation, as well as the dynamic exchanges of flows between regions. We conclude by illustrating how Geographic Information Science (GIScience) can help address these challenges, enabling much deeper and wider integration of ecosystem service accounting in the LCA field.},

The challenge is to turn this recognition into incentives and institutions that will guide wise investments in natural capital, on a large scale. Advances are required on three key fronts, each featured here: the science of ecosystem production functions and service mapping; the design of appropriate finance, policy, and governance systems; and the art of implementing these in diverse biophysical and social contexts. Scientific understanding of ecosystem production functions is improving rapidly but remains a limiting factor in incorporating natural capital into decisions, via systems of national accounting and other mechanisms. Novel institutional structures are being established for a broad array of services and places, creating a need and opportunity for systematic assessment of their scope and limitations. Finally, it is clear that formal sharing of experience, and defining of priorities for future work, could greatly accelerate the rate of innovation and uptake of new approaches. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {This paper presents an integrated literature review on how the environmental sustainability of distributed production is studied in a variety of disciplinary sources. The notion of distributed production suggests an alternative to mass production that differs in scale, location and consumer-producer relationship. Understanding its environmental implications (and thereby dematerialization potential) is regarded pertinent and timely. Key themes in the review included how distributed production can promote product longevity and closed material loops, as well as localizing production. New and closer ties between producer and consumer seemed central discussions but were underdeveloped with regard to sustainability potential. Empirical work was seen especially in research on Additive Manufacturing Processes, while the bulk of the studies were conceptual explorations with little testing in the real world as yet. This affirms the emerging nature of the topic and points to a clear need for more (and more diverse) empirical research. The review summarizes the opportunities for greater environmental sustainability as well as potential threats that could serve to guide and improve these novel practices today. It sets the stage for 'distributed production' to be examined as its own phenomenon by proposing how it can be characterized and suggests that a research agenda could build upon the work initiated here.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to measure the effect of process conditions on mechanical properties of laser-sintered nylon 12 (DuraformUP/UP) and to determine the range of conditions that provide consistent mechanical performance for additive manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach - Tensile test specimens were fabricated over a range of well-characterized process conditions including laser power, laser speed, scan spacing, layer thickness, build orientation, and build position. Tensile modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation-at-fracture were measured and related to process parameters. Findings - Tensile properties are strongly related to the amount of energy deposited during scanning. Strength and modulus approach their maximum values as the energy deposited exceeds the amount needed to fully melt the applied powder. Elongation-at-fracture does not reach its maximum until higher energy-melt ratio. Performance of blends with reused powder matches that of virgin powder when blend composition is adjusted to a standard melt-flow index. The volumetric energy density and the energy-melt ratio are useful for correlating mechanical properties with multiple process parameters and material thermal properties. Originality/value - This work presents the most extensive data to date on mechanical properties of nylon 12 (DuraformUP/UP) as they relate to the full range of process parameters. These data show that mechanical performance correlates strongly with the volume energy density. In contrast to the area energy density (a.k.a. Andrews Number), this volumetric parameter includes the effect of varying layer thickness and can be related directly to the melting characteristics of the polymer material. Within the parameter range studied, this relationship allows adjustment of one scan parameter for improved speed or dimensional accuracy while ensuring good strength by an offsetting adjustment of another parameter. Such trade-offs will be important in future manufacturing applications of the laser sintering process. Understanding the energy-melt ratio provides insight into the relationship between scan conditions and the physics of powder melting and sintering, and offers a methodology to relate results at other bed temperatures and with other polymer powders. {\&}copy; 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

abstract = {Circular Economy (CE) aims to overcome the take-make-dispose linear pattern of production and consumption, proposing a circular system in which the value of products, materials and resources is maintained in the economy as long as possible. In recent years there has been a proliferation of scholars' publications on the topic. This study presents the results of a systematic literature review exploring the state-of-the-art of academic research on CE. The paper examines the CE body of literature with a systematic approach, to provide an exhaustive analysis of the phenomenon with rigorous and reproducible research criteria. The revisited material consists of 565 articles collected through the Web of Science and Scopus databases, and has been evaluated using specific structural dimensions to group literature into analytical categories. Starting from being a concept studied in connection with industrial ecology, CE has slowly acquired its independent role in academic research, framed mainly into environmental sustainability related studies. As a result of policies implementation, academic production is mainly concentrated in China and Europe, employing tools and methods for modelling processes and supporting decision-making for CE implementation (e.g. Life Cycle Assessment and Material Flow Analysis). CE studies follow three main lines of action: the first aims to change the social and economic dynamics at macro and administrative level; the second to support firms in circular processes implementation at micro level to spread new forms of consumption and product design; the third, developed at meso level, discusses industrial symbiosis experiences. CE is associated with a variety of concepts, and waste management emerges as the most relevant sub-sector. CE is also strongly connected with the concept of sustainability, proposing ways to operationalize its implementation at the environmental and economic level, while scholars only marginally consider social and institutional implications. The most explored practices are those related to cleaner production, aiming at reducing environmental impact and waste production along the life cycle of a product, and optimizing the performance and efficiency of processes. Conversely, studies on CE may devote greater attention to strategies for social and institutional changes, able to transform the upstream process of production and consumption. Considering business model strategies, scholars mainly focus on studying closing material loops strategy, while slowing the loops, which requires a radical change of consumption and production patterns, is only marginally included with respect to CE implementation. This study's findings highlight CE as an evolving concept that still requires development to consolidate its definition, boundaries, principles and associated practices.},

While much of recent research has focused on impact of technological progress and globalization on increased inequalities, few studies have systematically investigated complementary and convergent measures to achieve equality and sustainability. To dismantle common misconceptions and concerns, embedded in fragmented and linear ways of seeing complex phenomena, a conceptual paper is developed. By assuming a systemic and multilevel approach, the research illustrates how technological progress, globalization, economic growth and social equity could be reconciled. Without a systemic orientation, the real causes and solutions to inequality problems are not recognized. When a systemic approach is used, technological progress appears as a driver for equality solutions rather than a source of inequality, while education becomes the best antidote to unemployment.},

Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), oxidation induction time (OIT), melt flow index (MFI) and cone-plate rheometry measurements were performed. Also, atomic absorption spectrophotometry tests were carried out to verify which catalytic residue was present in the recycled HDPE so as to correlate it to the degradation processes taking place in the polymer. The results showed that in this case the post-consumer HDPE displayed cross-linking when reprocessed, indicating the need for re-stabilization. They also showed that the use of 0.2{\%} antioxidant was efficient in blocking these processes, and that the cone-plate rheometry technique was powerful in assessing degradative processes. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Decision on end-of-life product recovery options is affected by many factors; they are factors related to engineering, business, environmental, and societal factors. These factors come from wide spectrum of stakeholders' interests. Perspectives vary from one stakeholder to another; hence, some of these factors are conflicting. For example, product designers' interest in composite light weight material may conflict with recycler's interest in pure and easy-to-recycle material. A method that identifies all stakeholders who are directly involved or indirectly affected by such decision would be beneficial to the selection of right product recovery option. This paper provides a method that guides the process of decision making on end-of-life product recovery option. The method is different from previous ones in its inclusion of all stakeholders who has interest in the process. The proposed method gives decision maker flexibility to accommodate for different cases (Case specific situations). It is enough comprehensive to be general and enough flexible to be specific, this would make the decision taken using this method accurate by selecting appropriate recovery options, and informative by presenting the most influential factors that lead to the decision. Previous methods found in literature are reviewed and been inconsideration when developing the proposed method. Knowledge obtained from industrial best practices and well documented case studies also included. Product designers and business decision makers would benefit from this work on deciding about the fate of their product as a whole or its constituents. The implementation of the developed method is demonstrated through an industrial product; the method robustness is tested by assessing its sensitivity to extreme situations. In conclusion, the decision on end-of-life product recovery option is governed by different stakeholders. A method that considers the collective interests of all stakeholders is apparently needed; such method is developed in this paper and is validated using industrial example. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Modeling the structure and evolution of products is important from the standpoint of improving quality and maintainability. With the increasing popularity of open-source processes for developing both software and physical systems, there is a need to develop computational models of product evolution in such dynamic product developments scenarios. Existing studies on the evolution of products involve modeling products as networks, taking snapshots of the structure at different time steps, and comparing the structural characteristics. Such approaches are limited because they do not capture the underlying dynamics through which products evolve. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing this gap by presenting a generative network model for product evolution. The generative model is based on different mechanisms though which networks evolve—addition and removal of nodes, addition and removal of links. The model links local network observations to global network structures. It is utilized for modeling and analyzing the evolution of a software product (Drupal) and a physical product (RepRap) developed by open source processes. For the software product, the generated networks are compared with the actual product structures using various network measures including average degree, density, clustering coefficients, average shortest path, propagation cost, clustered cost, and degree distributions. For the physical product, the product evolution is analyzed in terms of the proposed mechanisms. The proposed model has three general applications: longitudinal studies of a product's evolution, cross-sectional studies of evolution of different products, and predictive analyzes.},

abstract = {The recently developed dual-stage 3D printing reprocessable thermosets (3DPRTs) utilize acrylate functional groups to enable the ultra-violet based 3D printing (Stage I), and employ bond exchange reaction (BERs) to tailor the network structure for mechanical properties enhancement and impart the reshapeability, reparability, and recyclability into traditionally unprocessable thermosets (Stage II). 3DPRT provides a practical solution to address environmental challenges associated with the rapid increase in the consumption of 3D printing materials. However, due to the nascent state of development, fundamental understanding of the chemomechanics during the processing of 3DPRTs is still lacking. In this paper, we present detailed experimental and theoretical studies to understand the effect of thermal treatment condition at Stage II on the evolution of network structure and thermomechanical properties of 3DPRTs. A chemomechanics theory is defined to link the molecular-level BER kinetics to the macroscale thermomechanical properties of 3DPRTs during the thermal treatment. A thermo-viscoelastic multi-branched constitutive model is then established to capture the elastic and glass transition behaviors during the Stage II processing. The developed theory is able to capture the experimental observations on the mechanical properties enhancement and provide theoretical guidance for the network design and the selection of thermal treatment conditions to tailor the final mechanical properties of 3DPRTs.},

abstract = {The development of additive manufacturing (AM) technology provides the possibility of producing complex parts (including internal complex features) that are difficult to manufacture by machining. However, AM technologies also have some limitations, such as low-dimensional accuracy and long production times. Recently, combining additive manufacturing technology with CNC machining is gaining significant attention. This combination not only takes advantages of individual techniques, but also minimizes their disadvantages. In this paper, taking into account consolidated benefits of such technique combination, an alternative remanufacturing strategy is proposed. The strategy allows end-of-life parts (or existing parts) to be reused directly for manufacture of new parts (or final parts) without involving the material recycling stage. In addition, the final part is intended for another product, namely the existing part has a new life and new usage in its life cycle. To achieve the geometry and quality of final part, a sequence of additive, subtractive manufacturing and inspection operations will be generated. For this purpose, additive manufacturing features and machining features are first identified and extracted from the available information of the existing and final parts. This paper particularly focuses on a feature extraction approach, which is developed using the knowledge of additive manufacturing and CNC machining processes, technological requirements, and available resources. The major criteria and constraints have been defined and applied during the feature extraction process. The extracted features and their relationships will be used as the inputs for designing the process planning. Finally, a case study is used to illustrate the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} 2017 Springer-Verlag France},

An overview of the literature was established and the literature was analyzed with regard to (1) common and diverging perspectives on Living Labs, (2) the state-of-the-art of Living Lab processes and methods, and (3) theoretical foundations of Living Labs. On the basis of the analyses, a common Living Lab definition is suggested. Two emerging Living Lab trends, as well as a pressing need for future research on Living Lab processes and methods, are introduced and discussed.},

@article{Robinson2005,
abstract = {This paper summarises the results of two large-scale surveys of households in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in Greater London. The first, performed in 2000, covered 7500 households and the second, in 2004, 3250 households. Respondents provided information on their use of the local authority's kerbside recycling scheme and 'bring' sites for recycled materials. In 2000, approximately half of the householders surveyed via face-to-face interviews claimed that they used the kerbside scheme and/or bring sites on a regular basis. This proportion had grown to 70{\%} in 2004. Details of this usage are outlined, including consideration of stated reasons for non-participation in waste recycling activities and reasons for variation in recycling behaviour across the borough. The context for this research is the establishment of national and local authority targets for the amount of household waste to be recycled. Given widespread concern that these targets are not being met, the research project not only evaluated the effectiveness of the existing opportunities for householders in Kensington and Chelsea but also promoted participation in recycling. One effect of this promotion was an observable increase in the amount of waste for recycling following both surveys. A key conclusion is that large-scale house-to-house publicity of local recycling opportunities has a demonstrable positive effect, but that for current targets to be met more householders need to be convinced of the need to recycle. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {How can individual scientists most effectively spread the adoption of open science practices? Engaging in open science practices presents a social dilemma because they are individually costly (given the current incentive schemes in academia) but collectively beneficial (due to production of higher quality and more accessible science). Mechanisms for promoting cooperation in social dilemmas typically rely on normativity-but open science practices are still comparatively rare. Further, individuals may be tempted to dishonestly "virtue signal" due to growing support for open science. We formulate a solution based on the theory of credibility-enhancing displays: advocates who are known to themselves practice the behavior they are advocating for (particularly if they are prestigious) are more effective at convincing others-specifically because their actions provide an honest signal of their belief in the behavior's value. Thus, advocates for open science practices should find ways to engage in those practices visibly and often.},

abstract = {There are three primary aspects to the economics of additive$\backslash$nmanufacturing: measuring the value of goods produced, measuring the$\backslash$ncosts and benefits of using the technology, and estimating the adoption$\backslash$nand diffusion of the technology. This paper provides an updated estimate$\backslash$nof the value of goods produced. It then reviews the literature on$\backslash$nadditive manufacturing costs and identifies those instances in the$\backslash$nliterature where this technology is cost-effective. The paper then goes$\backslash$non to propose an approach for examining and understanding the societal$\backslash$ncosts and benefits of this technology both from a monetary viewpoint and$\backslash$na resource consumption viewpoint. The final section discusses the trends$\backslash$nin the adoption of additive manufacturing. Globally, there is an$\backslash$nestimated {\$}667 million in value added produced using additive\backslashnmanufacturing, which equates to 0.01 {\%} of total global manufacturing\backslashnvalue added. US value added is estimated as {\$}241 million. Current$\backslash$nresearch on additive manufacturing costs reveals that it is$\backslash$ncost-effective for manufacturing small batches with continued$\backslash$ncentralized production; however, with increased automation distributed$\backslash$nproduction may become cost-effective. Due to the complexities of$\backslash$nmeasuring additive manufacturing costs and data limitations, current$\backslash$nstudies are limited in their scope. Many of the current studies examine$\backslash$nthe production of single parts and those that examine assemblies tend$\backslash$nnot to examine supply chain effects such as inventory and transportation$\backslash$ncosts along with decreased risk to supply disruption. The additive$\backslash$nmanufacturing system and the material costs constitute a significant$\backslash$nportion of an additive manufactured product; however, these costs are$\backslash$ndeclining over time. The current trends in costs and benefits have$\backslash$nresulted in this technology representing 0.02 {\%} of the relevant$\backslash$nmanufacturing industries in the USA; however, as the costs of additive$\backslash$nmanufacturing systems decrease, this technology may become widely$\backslash$nadopted and change the supplier, manufacturer, and consumer$\backslash$ninteractions. An examination in the adoption of additive manufacturing$\backslash$nreveals that for this technology to exceed {\$}4.4 billion in 2020, {\$}16.0$\backslash$nbillion in 2025, and {\$}196.8 billion in 2035, it would need to deviate\backslashnfrom its current trends of adoption.},

In order to support recycling projects it is important to try to understand who recycles, how they recycle, and why they recycle. This paper presents the results of a structured survey of 500 members of the public served by schemes to collect plastics waste for recycling. Data were gathered on the characteristics, behaviours and motivations of recyclers. The authors also sought to discover how the public perceive plastics compared to other materials, and as a recyclable material. Responses were collected in such a way that the awareness of the recyclability of materials could be compared with the recycling behaviour of respondents. An element of comparison was introduced between those served by a system of bottle banks (bring scheme) and those covered by a household collection (collect scheme). The survey results are reported and their implications for the management of post- consumer plastics waste collection schemes are discussed.},

abstract = {Accelerated thermal and photo-aging of four homopolymers, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) and high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), was performed and the impact of subsequent reprocessing conditions on their properties studied. Polymer samples oven-aged at 100 ??C for varying periods of time or UV irradiated in a Weather-o-meter (WOM) at ?? = 340 nm were reprocessed in a Brabender plasticorder at 190 ??C/60 rpm for 10 min. Chemical changes and the evolution of rheological and mechanical properties accompanying the gradual degradation of the individual polymers were monitored and evaluated (DSC, FTIR, colorimetric method, MFI, tensile impact strength). LDPE and HIPS were found to be more susceptible to thermo-oxidation than HDPE and PP, whereas HDPE and PP were affected to a greater extent by UV exposure; the crucial role here is being played by the stabilization of the studied resins. In HDPE the scission and crosslinking reactions competed both in thermo-and photo-degradation. In the case of LDPE, scission prevailed over branching during thermo-oxidation, whereas photo-oxidation of the same sample led predominantly to crosslinking. Abrupt deterioration of the LDPE rheological properties after one week of thermal exposure was suppressed by re-stabilization. The scission reaction was also predominant for PP during thermo-oxidation, and it took place even faster during UV exposure. In the case of HIPS a slight photo-degradation of PS matrix is accompanied by simultaneous crosslinking of the polybutadiene component. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This study is the first one realised in Turkey for the detailed characterisation of marine waste. The amount and characteristics of solid wastes originating from beaches, coastlines, sea surface cleaning processes and ships (both cargo and cruise ships) were determined. It was observed that marine wastes includes a significant amount of recyclable materials. Although, it was ascertained that the amount and composition of waste differs according to the collecting sources, the majority of wastes are composed of different types of plastics. The average calorific value of marine waste was determined as 2500 kcal kg-1, which is higher than that of mixed municipal solid waste. There is a lack of studies on the pathways of disposal alternatives of marine waste after collection. As landfilling is the common pathway for disposal after collecting, it is clear that recycle/reuse and energy recovery options are possible for marine waste.},

Surprisingly, such tools have been rarely used in this literature despite widespread availability and use in other fields to make sense of complex data. We trace the history of visualizations from the early work of Minard and Snow up to the sophisticated, web-based interactive graphics we have today, and identify forms of visualization and their uses. We apply these tools to a specific preliminary case study: the number, location, and timeline of waste disposal projects in developing countries registered with the Clean Development Mechanism as climate offsets. This preliminary case gets at unexpected linkages across climate and waste governance at the international level, and allows us to start to see local impacts of global mitigation and market mechanisms. Using Tableau, we have generated a series of maps and other visualizations that make trends and patterns visible—helping to spark further research. We conclude by discussing the implications of visualization tools for fields of global environmental politics and governance, and critiques of visualization from practical and theoretical viewpoints. We note their connection to wider political debates around accessibility of data and science.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper describes the development of a model for classifying the different type of 'design demonstrator' that might be used in translating scientific activity from the laboratory to the market. Two detailed case studies are described in which designers worked closely with scientists. In one of the projects, the scientists were seeking to commercialise their research. In the other, the research was at an early stage and the scientists had not considered commercialisation. Different types of physical artefact produced in these collaborative projects were analysed to identify the extent to which they might contribute to science, technology, application or market. Evidence indicates that demonstrators might fulfil multiple purposes and that the translation from science to market is more complicated than is often shown in linear models. An original classification of the role of demonstrators through this journey is provided.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as additive manufacturing, permits the fabrication of fully customized objects with a high level of geometrical complexity at reduced fabrication time and cost. Besides metals and ceramics, polymers have become a widely researched class of materials for applications in AM. The synthetic versatility and adaptability, as well as the wide range of properties that can be achieved using polymer materials, have rendered polymers the most widely employed class of materials for AM methodologies. In this review, the basic principles, considering the printing mechanism as well as the advantages and disadvantages, of the most relevant polymer AM technologies are described. The particular features, properties and limitations of currently employed polymer systems in the various AM technology areas are presented and analyzed. Subsequently, 4D printing, that is the fabrication of 3D printed structures that are cabable to change with time, is discussed. A brief description of the polymeric materials and technologies under development for 4D printed structures as well as the different shape changes explored are presented. Finally, based on the characteristics of the polymers employed for each technology illustrative examples of the principal applications are discussed.},

abstract = {Waste will become the major resource in the future circular economy. In particular, E-waste is a major sector growing at an annual rate of about 2 million tonnes (Mt) with rising users of electrical and electronic items worldwide. This is a consequence of versatility and affordability of technological innovation, thus resulting in massive sales and e-waste increases. Most end-users lack knowledge on proper recycling or reuse, often disposing of e-waste as domestic waste. Such improper disposals are threatening life and ecosystems because e-waste is rich in toxic metals and other pollutants. Here we review e-waste generation, policies and recycling methods. In 2019, the world e-waste production reached 53.6 Mt, including 24.9 Mt in Asia, 13.1 Mt in USA, 12 Mt in Europe. In Asia, China (10.1 Mt), India (3.23 Mt), Japan (2.57 Mt) and Indonesia (1.62 Mt) are the largest producers contributing to about 70{\%} of the total world e-waste generated. Only 17.4{\%} (9.3 Mt) of the world e-waste was recycled by formal means, and the remaining 82.6{\%} (44.3 Mt) was left untreated or processed informally. As a consequence, most countries have framed policies to provide regulatory guidelines to producers, end-users and recyclers. Yet the efficiency of these local policies are limited by the transfer of products across borders in a globalized world. Among formal recycling techniques, biohydrometallurgy appears most promising compared to pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy, because biohydrometallurgy overcomes limitations such as poor yield, high capital cost, toxic chemicals, release of toxic gases and secondary waste generation. Challenges include consumer's contempt on e-waste disposal, the deficit of recycling firms and technology barriers.},

Hardware released under free licenses$\backslash$r$\backslash$nis known as free and open source hardware (FOSH). The availability of these$\backslash$r$\backslash$nFOSH designs has a large value to those with access to digital manufacturing methods$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand particularly for scientists with needs for highly-customized low-volume$\backslash$r$\backslash$nproduction products. It is challenging to use traditional funding models to$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsupport the necessary investment of resources in FOSH development because of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe difficulty in quantifying the value of the result. In order to overcome$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthat challenge and harvest the current opportunity in both low-cost scientific$\backslash$r$\backslash$nequipment and consumer products, this article evaluates the following methods$\backslash$r$\backslash$nto quantify the value of FOSH design including: 1) downloaded substitution$\backslash$r$\backslash$nvaluation; 2) avoided reproduction valuation and 3) market savings valuation$\backslash$r$\backslash$nalong with additional benefits related to market expansion, scientific$\backslash$r$\backslash$ninnovation acceleration, educational enhancement and medical care improvement.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe strengths and weaknesses of these methods are analyzed and the results show$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthat the methods are relatively straight-forward to institute, based on$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreliable freely-available data, and that they minimize assumptions.

abstract = {Recently, interest in composite manufacturing has shifted towards the use of natural fibres as reinforcement because of their environmental benefits. The use of a biodegradable matrix is worth considering since this would result in a completely biodegradable composite. In order to assess the most suitable matrix polymer, one must know the properties of the available polymers. Since data tend to be widely scattered over many sources and are very scarce compared to the conventional polymers, it is the purpose of this article to give an overview of the most relevant properties of a range of biodegradable polymers. An overview such as the one given here may provide a useful guide in establishing the best compromise between conflicting property demands. Data are presented mostly as ranges (in tables) as well as in graphs for quick comparison reasons. One specific application (thermoplastic pultrusion with flax as reinforcement) is also studied. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Goal, Scope and Background. The object of the study is the Ital- ian system of plastic packaging waste recycling, active until 2001, that collected and mechanically recycled the post-consumer PE and PET liquid containers. The phases of collection, compaction, sorting, reprocessing and refuse disposal were individually ana- lysed and quantified in terms of energy and material consumptions as well as of emissions in the environment. The work is the result of a joint research project with the Italian Consortium for Pack- aging (CONAI), carried out in co-operation with the main Italian companies active in the field. The main aim was the quantifica- tion of the real advantage of plastic container recycling and the definition of criteria, at the same time environmentally compat- ible and economically sustainable, for their management. Main Features. For each of the unit processes, and in order to in- crease the data quality, all the data of interest were collected during technical visits to several selected plants active in Italy or deduced by official documents and certificate declarations of the same com- panies. To allow comparison of resource consumption and envi- ronmental pollution from different management scenarios produc- ing different products, the basket of products method was applied. Results. The results indicates that the production of I kg of flakes of recycled PET requires a total amount of gross energy that is in the range of between 42 and 55 M J, depending on whether the process wastes (mainly coming from sorting and reprocessing ac- tivities) were sent or not to the energy recovery. The same quan- tity of virgin PET requires more than 77 MJ. The energetic (and then environmental) saving is so remarkable, even for PE, being 40-49 MJ for the recycled polymer and about 80 MJ that for the virgin polyolefin. The calculations were made with the reason- able assumption that the final utilisation can use the virgin or the recycled polymer without any difference. Conclusions and Outlook. The analysis defined and verified a suitable tool in the field, based on objective data, for comparing different coherent scenarios of waste management politics. This allows one to propose the extension of the tool under different collection schemes, as well as for different systems of packaging recycling. As an immediate consequence of the success of the present study, the joint-research programme with CONAI has been extended for another three years. The focus will be the Italian system for paper and paperboard recycling and that for all plastic packagings. In parallel, a different study has been scheduled with reference to the integrated solid waste manage- ment of the Regione Campania, the largest and most populated area in the South of Italy.

User expertise (expert vs. novice) and prototype fidelity (paper prototype, 3D mock-up, and fully operational appliance) were manipulated as independent variables in a 2 × 3 between-subjects design. Employing a floor scrubber as a model product, 48 users carried out several cleaning tasks. Usability problems identified by participants were recorded. Furthermore, performance, system management strategies and perceived usability were measured. The results showed that experts reported more usability problems than novices but these were considered to be less severe than those reported by novices. Reduced fidelity prototypes were generally suitable to predict product usability of the real appliance. The implications for the running of usability tests are specific to the fidelity of the prototype. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {3D printing, more formally known as Additive Manufacturing (AM), is already being adopted for rapid prototyping and soon rapid manufacturing. This review provides a brief discussion about AM and also the most employed AM technologies for polymers. The commonly-used ASTM and ISO mechanical test standards which have been used by various research groups to test the strength of the 3D-printed parts have been reported. Also, a summary of an exhaustive amount of literature regarding the mechanical properties of 3D-printed parts is included, specifically, properties under different loading types such as tensile, bending, compressive, fatigue, impact and others. Properties at low temperatures have also been discussed. Further, the effects of fillers as well as post-processing on the mechanical properties have also been discussed. Lastly, several important questions to consider in the standardization of mechanical test methods have been raised.},

abstract = {Sustainable Consumption and Production is one of the leading principle towards reducing environmental impacts globally. This study aims at combining Environmentally-Extended Input-Output Analysis (using EXIOBASE 3) with up-to-date impact assessment models to quantify the environmental impacts induced by final consumption in the EU Member States in 2011. The environmental extensions are characterized in 14 environmental impact categories out of the 16 used in the Environmental Footprint life cycle impact assessment method. A contribution analysis of key products and services as well as emissions and resources, which drive the environmental impacts of EU consumption, is conducted. Environmental impacts are mainly induced along the supply-chain of products and services. Several expenditures relative to services represent large shares both in the total final consumption and in the 14 impacts under study, despite a relatively low impact intensity. Food products, in particular meat and dairy products, are identified as key contributors regarding acidification, eutrophication, land use, and water use, and to a lower extent climate change. Finally, several manufactured products, raw materials and basic products respectively importantly contribute to impacts on human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity and resource uses. The total volume of final consumption expenditures per EU Member State appears a key explanatory variable to most of the impacts embodied in their consumption, yet to a lower extent regarding water use and fossils resource use. Finally, the current limitations in using EXIOBASE 3 for environmental impact assessment are discussed, with specific attention to EXIOBASE environmental extensions and to the case study on EU consumption. Since the classification of emissions and resources for impact assessment requires a number of assumptions that may influence the results, a sensitivity analysis is performed to exemplify some of the key issues relative to the characterization of impacts based on EXIOBASE environmental extensions.},

@article{Murray2017,
abstract = {There have long been calls from industry for guidance in implementing strategies for sustainable development. The Circular Economy represents the most recent attempt to conceptualize the integration of economic activity and environmental wellbeing in a sustainable way. This set of ideas has been adopted by China as the basis of their economic development (included in both the 11th and the 12th ‘Five Year Plan'), escalating the concept in minds of western policymakers and NGOs. This paper traces the conceptualisations and origins of the Circular Economy, tracing its meanings, and exploring its antecedents in economics and ecology, and discusses how the Circular Economy has been operationalized in business and policy. The paper finds that while the Circular Economy places emphasis on the redesign of processes and cycling of materials, which may contribute to more sustainable business models, it also encapsulates tensions and limitations. These include an absence of the social dimension inherent in sustainable development that limits its ethical dimensions, and some unintended consequences. This leads us to propose a revised definition of the Circular Economy as “an economic model wherein planning, resourcing, procurement, production and reprocessing are designed and managed, as both process and output, to maximize ecosystem functioning and human well-being”.},

abstract = {The term additive manufacturing (AM) describes a collection of production techniques enabling the layer-by-layer manufacture of components using digital data and raw material as inputs. The AM technology variant most frequently used in the production of end use parts is laser sintering (LS). It has been suggested that efficient usage of the energy inputs is one of the advantages of the technology. This paper presents a comparative assessment of the electricity consumptions of two major polymeric LS platforms: the Sinterstation HiQ + HS from 3D Systems and the EOSINT P 390 from EOS GmbH. The energy inputs to a build consisting of two prosthetic parts were recorded during power-monitoring experiments conducted on both platforms. This paper injects clarity into the ongoing research on the AM energy consumption by applying a novel classification system; it is argued that the AM energy usage can be divided into the job-dependent, time-dependent, geometry-dependent, and Z-height-dependent energy consumption values. The recorded mean real power consumption conforms to the values that have been reported for similar platforms. The measured energy consumption rates are higher than reported elsewhere. It is also shown that the purely time-dependent energy consumption is the main energy drain. Furthermore, the presentation of results in the context of previous literature highlights the caveats attached to summary metrics of the AM input usage.},

abstract = {The concept of circularity and its quantification through the Material Circularity Indicator (MCI) is well established for traditional plastic products. In this paper a methodological approach for calculating the circularity of bio-based and biodegradable (BB) products is proposed and applied to BB mulch films. BB products are different from traditional products in as much as they are sourced and regenerated (recycled) not through technical cycles but the biological loop. The suggested method is an adaptation of the MCI where two major changes were made: (i) the mass of the bio-based component corresponds to the recycled material in input and (ii) the mass of the bio-based component leaving the system through composting or biodegradation in soil is accounted as recycled. The modified MCI supports the eco-design of innovative BB products and allows for the comparison of their circularity taking into account the biological source and the expected end of life process such as biodegradation. To demonstrate the adaptation, the method has been applied to BB mulch films. Results showed that the MCI of a biodegradable mulch film, characterized by an average bio-based feedstock content of 30{\%} is 0.37 ± 0.04 in a 0–1 scale. For BB mulch film, the amount of bio-based feedstock is the most sensitive factor and controls linearly the value of the MCI.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering. The processing of elastomers through fused deposition modeling (FDM) is challenging task due to low column strength and high melt viscosity. Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) is an elastomer which is widely used for fabricating flexible objects. However, the potential of this material has not been explored in the FDM process. Pre-fabricated EVA filament cannot be processed in standard filament feed extrusion mechanism of commercial FDM machine due to buckling of the filament. However, development of pellet-based extrusion additive manufacturing (AM) may eliminate the issues caused by elastomer filament. The current study demonstrates the development of pellet-based AM system for processing EVA material. The developed system is compatible with the three-axis CNC milling machine, which provides high precision positioning to the deposition path and required power for screw rotation. Details about hardware and software related to the developed system have been presented. Flexible parts using EVA pellets have been fabricated successfully, which shows the capability of the developed extrusion AM system. Experiments have been performed for tuning process parameters. Further, mechanical characterization has been done to analyze the dimensional accuracy, flexibility, strength and hardness of printed parts. Obtained results show that EVA demonstrates approx. 300–550{\%} higher elongation as compared to ABS and PLA materials, which indicates EVA can be used to make highly flexible parts. The outcome of this study will be helpful to the engineers for the development of low-cost flexible parts for those applications where customized flexible parts are needed in short span of time.},

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) produces three dimensional objects directly from a digital model by the successive addition of material(s), without the use of a specialized tooling. AM allows the rapid development of sustainable products and has been increasingly used to produce lightweight components to save materials and costs. This particularly helps to save a considerable amount of material, energy and cost for the production of one-off or small volume products. In addition, the non-processed raw materials can be recycled and re-used by AM to reduce material waste drastically. AM is therefore considered as a sustainable manufacturing approach driving the rapid development of new products. The paper will present and review the research activities performed in the University of Exeter to enhance the sustainability of AM. These research activities include: 1) sustainable product design by optimising internal lightweight structures; 2) improvement of process efficiency by optimising AM process parameters; 3) reduction of energy consumption by in situ thermite material reaction; 4) sustainable production of personalised chocolates.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is poised to bring about a revolution in the way products are designed, manufactured and distributed to end users. This technology has gained significant academic as well as industry interest due to its ability to create complex geometries with customizable material properties. AM has also inspired the development of the maker movement by democratizing design and manufacturing. Due to the rapid proliferation of a wide variety of technologies associated with AM, there is a lack of a comprehensive set of design principles, manufacturing guidelines, and standardization of best practices. These challenges are compounded by the fact that advancements in multiple technologies (for example materials processing, topology optimization) generate a “positive feedback loop” effect in advancing AM. In order to advance research interest and investment in AM technologies, some fundamental questions and trends about the dependencies existing in these avenues need highlighting. The goal of our review paper is to organize this body of knowledge surrounding AM, and present current barriers, findings and future trends significantly to the researchers. We also discuss fundamental attributes of AM processes, evolution of the AM industry, and the affordances enabled by the emergence of AM in a variety of areas such as geometry processing, material design and education. We conclude our paper by pointing out future directions such as the “print-it-all” paradigm, that have the potential to re-imagine current research and spawn completely new avenues for exploration.},

The 60 participants of the experiment were asked to complete two typical tasks of mobile phone usage: sending a text message and suppressing a phone number. Both performance data and a number of subjective measures were recorded. The results suggested that task completion time may be overestimated when a computer prototype is being used. Furthermore, users appeared to compensate for deficiencies in aesthetic design by overrating the aesthetic qualities of reduced fidelity prototypes. Finally, user emotions were more positively affected by the operation of the more attractive mobile phone than by the less appealing one. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To date, the services and goods products have, for the most part, been separately mass produced. However, in contrast to the first and second industrial revolutions which respectively focused on the development and the mass production of goods, the next - or third - industrial revolution is focused on the integration of services and/or goods; it is beginning in this second decade of the 21st Century. The Third Industrial Revolution (TIR) is based on the confluence of three major technological enablers (i. e., big data analytics, adaptive services and digital manufacturing); they underpin the integration or mass customization of services and/or goods. As detailed in an earlier paper, we regard mass customization as the simultaneous and real-time management of supply and demand chains, based on a taxonomy that can be defined in terms of its underpinning component and management foci. The benefits of real-time mass customization cannot be over-stated as goods and services become indistinguishable and are co-produced - as "servgoods" - in real-time, resulting in an overwhelming economic advantage to the industrialized countries where the consuming customers are at the same time the co-producing producers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is established not only in prototyping, but also in serial production of end-use products. To use the full potential of the production technology the restrictions of current additive manufacturing processes (like support structures in Selective Laser Melting) must be considered in the design process. Especially the compliance with design rules from early design stages on is important in AM serial production, due to production quantities and the resulting scale effect. The part orientation in the build space has a strong influence on many quality characteristics. In order to use the full potential and to consider the restrictions from the start, a design guideline is necessary to support the whole design process. For this purpose, this paper presents a framework for design guidelines. The framework distinguishes between process characteristics, design principles and design rules; each supporting the designer during different stages of the design process. Furthermore, the paper examines the influence of part orientation in existing design rules and elaborates its importance. Based on this result, the design principle "early determination of part orientation" is presented, which includes a process for determining the part orientation in early stage of the design process. In addition, a design process for additive manufactured parts is demonstrated on an extensive showcase, following the guideline framework and including the principle for early determination of part orientation. The presented framework proved to be helpful in the design process and will be used in the future to collect more process characteristics, design principles and rules.},

@article{Roithner2020,
abstract = {With the proposed Circular Economy Package, the European Union is striving to play a leading role in the implementation of recycling goals. The significantly increased recycling targets are just some of the defined objectives. However, to assess the Member States' attainment of the new recycling targets, the European Union still builds on a purely quantitative recycling rate assessment procedure that neglects to include qualitative recycling aspects. This circumstance could lead to additional quality losses in recycling processes because recyclers might tend to focus exclusively on higher quantities to achieve the stricter recycling targets on time. To prevent such a development, the aim of this study is to establish a complementary recycling indicator that combines quantitative and qualitative recycling aspects in one single metric. The basis of this assessment method is the statistical entropy approach, which enables the concentrating or diluting effect of a recycling process brought about through the separation or mixing of materials to be measured. The results of the statistical entropy metric will provide greater insight into recycling processes (or systems) and thereby yield enhanced information on the quantity and purity of recycling outputs. The simple structure of the new approach will allow enhanced comparisons between technologies as well as national recycling performance. A case study on plastic packaging recycling demonstrates that the new recycling indicator provides multifaceted findings relative to the hitherto purely quantitative recycling assessment data, hence enriching conclusions on the recycling performance.},

@article{Sanye-Mengual2019,
abstract = {Pursuing a responsible and sustainable development, the United Nations urged to decouple economic growth from environmental impacts. Several European Union (EU) policies have been implemented towards such goal. Although multiple authors have evaluated the decoupling of the economic growth from the resource use or environmental concerns, the environmental assessment mostly focused on pressures rather than impacts, and used single indicators assumed to be a proxy of the overall effects on the environment. Furthermore, no studies were found using a process-based life cycle approach to quantify the environmental impacts of consumption. To solve such research gap, this paper assesses the decoupling in the EU focusing on potential environmental impacts, complementing a production-based approach with two options for accounting for the impacts of consumption. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the decoupling of the economic growth (in terms of Gross Domestic Product) from the environmental impacts due to EU-28 consumption, assessed by means of life cycle assessment (LCA). The decoupling is then assessed in impact terms rather than limited to pressures by using the Environmental Footprint (EF2017) indicators, which allows assessing 16 different impacts. The Consumption Footprint indicator quantified the environmental impacts of EU apparent consumption, including the territorial impacts (Domestic Footprint) and the embodied impacts in both imports and exports (Trade Footprint). The inventory of pressures for the trade component is compiled either with a bottom-up approach (process-based LCA of representative traded goods) or a top-down approach (input-output-based LCA). Methodological aspects influencing the decoupling assessment and the resulting outputs are presented and discussed. According to the results, the environmental impacts of EU-28 consumption showed decoupling during the last decades (2005–2014), between relative to absolute decoupling depending on the inventory modeling approach taken. Some countries showed higher decoupling levels than others displaying a heterogeneous map of EU-28 decoupling, which was led by acidification, particulate matter, land use and eutrophication impacts. Notwithstanding current limitations, the assessment of decoupling using consumption-based environmental indicators is very promising for supporting policy-making towards addressing the actual impacts driven by the EU production and consumption system.},

abstract = {Increasing environmental uncertainty poses significant challenges for organizations. Although scholars generally agree that companies require dynamic capabilities to flexibly respond to and shape uncertain environments, only little empirical research has been conducted on the factors that facilitate the development of these capabilities. This study addresses this gap and introduces strategic foresight as an important antecedent of firms' dynamic capabilities. The paper investigates the impact of strategic foresight on two distinct types of dynamic capabilities, namely strategic flexibility and decision rationality, and how the influence of strategic foresight is moderated by the degree of environmental uncertainty. We test our hypotheses by adopting a mixed-methods approach, using both qualitative information gathered trough five expert interviews, as well as survey data collected from 79 managers familiar with strategic foresight practices. The obtained results indicate a significant positive impact of strategic foresight on firms' strategic flexibility and decision rationality. Furthermore, this study finds that environmental uncertainty strengthens the positive effect of strategic foresight on strategic flexibility. Contributions to strategic foresight research and managerial practice for firms trying to cope with continuously increasing levels of environmental uncertainty are discussed.},

abstract = {Surface ozone (O3) pollution, a critical environmental challenge facing government agencies at all levels, is becoming more and more serious in China, especially in rapidly developing urban areas like Beijing. However, in China, few studies have evaluated the contribution of various pollution sources to surface O3, e.g. motor vehicles. In this paper, we combined a non-linear model with an analysis of motor vehicle emissions of NOx and VOCs in an integrated approach to estimate the contribution of motor vehicle emissions to surface O3. The model showed that, in urban areas of Beijing in 2000, the contribution of motor vehicle emissions to surface O3 was 45.9{\%}, and that elimination of 20.0{\%} of motor vehicle emissions will lead to a 7.4{\%} reduction in surface O3, while elimination of 20.0{\%} of NOx or VOC emissions from motor vehicles will result in a 5.0{\%} and 2.5{\%} decline, respectively, in surface O3. In addition, elimination of 10,000 t of NOx from motor vehicles results in the same reduction in surface O3 as elimination of 25,631 t of VOCs. Thus, controlling NOx emissions from motor vehicles is an effective way to control surface O3 pollution in the study area.},

abstract = {In contrast to subtractive manufacturing techniques, additive manufacturing processes are known for their high efficiency in regards to utilisation of feedstock. However the various polymer, metallic and composite feedstocks used within additive manufacturing are mainly derived from energy consuming, inefficient methods, often originating from non-sustainable sources. This work explores the mechanical properties of additively manufactured composite structures fabricated from recycled sustainable wood waste with the aim of enhancing mechanical properties through glass fibre reinforcement. In the first instance, samples were formed by pouring formulation of wood waste (wood flour) and thermosetting binder (urea formaldehyde), with and without glass fibres, into a mould. The same formulations were used to additively manufacture samples via a layered deposition technique. Samples manufactured using each technique were cured and subsequently tested for their mechanical properties. Additively manufactured samples had superior mechanical properties, with up to 73{\%} increase in tensile strength compared to moulded composites due to a densification of feedstock/paste and fibre in-situ directional alignment.},

Using a 3-D coordinate measuring machine and surface profilometer, a series of measurements in evaluating the SLA parts quality has been conducted to find the functional relationships between the output part quality and input manufacturing process parameters. Two analysis tools, response surface methodology and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), have been used to evaluate the SLA RP process and to perform the product optimization. The optimal setups of SLA manufacturing parameters for both individual features and a general part with various features have been concluded from this study.},

abstract = {As part of the cosmos of digital fabrication technology, Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems are able to manufacture three-dimensional components and products directly from raw material and 3D design data. The layer-by-layer operating process of these systems does not require the use of tools, moulds or dies. Technology observers speculate that AM will have a profound economic impact on the manufacturing sector and indeed on wider society. By constructing a model of production cost for two different AM systems used commercially for the manufacture of end-use metal parts, Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), this paper performs an inter-process comparison of cost performance. High specific costs, measured at ??2.39 and ??6.18 per cm3 of material deposited respectively, are identified as a central impediment to more widespread technology adoption of such additive systems. The research demonstrates differing levels of system productivity, suggesting that the observed deposition rates are not sufficient for the adoption of EBM and DMLS in high volume manufacturing applications. Despite the absence of amortisable tooling costs, the analysis also reveals that economies of scale are achievable in AM. The results reached are further discussed in the light of the varying strategic requirements posed by the market-pull and technology-push modes of innovation which are both found in the AM industry.},

The resulting information-based economy is challenging traditional economic thought, as evidenced by the appearance of “Abundance” as an economic philosophy. Abundant economic thought is relatively undeveloped. Here, authors help define the field of Abundance based on the possibilities of the new information-based economy and the technological harbingers of I 4.0. Ten basic tenants of Technological Innovation Management (TIM) are presented as a basis for abundant economic thought. It is further shown that the Abundance perspective can elevate the Bottom Billion and nurture a sustainable and vibrant and growing middle class. Finally, we show one industry group that is operationalizing abundant economics.},

abstract = {The historical issue of natural resources scarcity is revived currently through the empirical investigation into the dependence of modern economy on the inputs of material and energy. The contemporary debate on de-growth and a-growth feeds on the empirical assessments of the relationship between energy-material use and current growth trends. In this context, the present study attempts a re-estimation of the energy-economic growth decoupling effect taking into account the physiology and, hence, the dimensionality that economic goods have. The Energy/GDP per Capita ratio is proposed as an indicator that approximates better than the Energy/GDP ratio the real world properties of production and, therefore, its energy requirements. The resulting estimations of decoupling effect are less "optimistic" than those based on Energy/GDP ratio and prevalent in the relevant contemporary literature. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

FIs also create new markets and contribute to sustainability. The studies so far have highlighted various frugal products introduced by large and small firms around the world. This study aims to explore the process of how individuals at the grassroots level successfully conceptualize, develop, and diffuse their FIs to achieve commercial success. It analyzes the antecedents, processes, and consequences of FI development and commercialization, and explores how FIs evolve and diffuse in emerging markets. It also seeks to identify what triggers and motivates individuals to engage in FI. The study points out the initiative that individuals take and the challenges they face, from inception to the successful commercialization of their innovations. We therefore portray an overall understanding of the antecedents, processes, and consequences for these entrepreneurs. Along with the scholars, the findings of this study will be insightful for practitioners who are interested in the frugal innovation phenomenon. It points out issues, such as the dual-business model, innovation to serve low-income customers, and diffusion patterns that managers need to understand when shaping their business strategies, for emerging markets in particular and the world in general.},

abstract = {Facilitating start-ups located in the port-city interface is one of the current policy strategies of municipalities in many port-cities worldwide to encourage innovations in constantly evolving port areas. This could help the re-development of vacant ex-port land, while also offering new economic orientations for the city and the port. The aim of the paper is therefore to explore what conditions are needed to facilitate and encourage start-ups in innovation ecosystems in the port-city interface. The analysis is based on two in-depth case studies of the port-cities of Montreal (Canada) and Rotterdam (the Netherlands). The results indicate that government initiatives to actively facilitate start-ups in formerly industrialized port areas are quite successful. However, the functional linkages between start-ups and port activities remains rather limited, if not entirely absent, and the impact on the functioning of the innovation ecosystem at large is not substantial. Other factors such as capital, collaboration and proximity are valued more than the physical location of the start-up. In this, other actors in the ecosystem besides the municipality and the port authority also play a key role. Furthermore, start-ups often feel limited in their innovative capacity because of stringent regulations and institutional rigidness. Governments and port authorities could facilitate in this respect by working more demand-driven in terms of unburdening and creating more institutional support, instead of imposing top-down rules and regulations to try to govern the ecosystem, which in itself can be considered a contradiction in terms.},

We analyze metadata of scientific publications in three scientific domains: Nano-Enabled Drug Delivery, Synthetic Biology, and Autonomous Vehicles. By employing a bibliometric indicator for identifying and quantifying emerging technological ideas – as derived terms from the titles and abstracts – we measure the extent to which the publication contains emerging technological ideas in each domain. Then, we statistically estimate the size and statistical significance of the relationship between the publication-level technological emergence score and the normalized number of citations accruing to the publication. Our analysis shows that the degree to which a paper contains technologically emerging ideas is positively and strongly associated with its future citation impact in each of the three domains. An additional analysis demonstrates that this relationship holds for citations from other publications, both in the same field as, and in different fields from, the scientific domain of the focal publication. A series of tests for validation further support our argument that the greater the extent to which scientific knowledge (a paper) contains emerging ideas, the bigger its scientific impact. Implications for academic researchers, research policymakers, and firms are discussed.},

a serious threat to the peaceful co-existence of the human and the

damage to our natural resources. This critical situation has given rise
to a pressing need for a cohesive and strategic research that can
address the needs of industries while simultaneously ensuring the
implementation of environmentally sustainable manufacturing methods.
However, the adoption of environmentally sustainable concepts is a
challenging task for industries and a thorough, comprehensive and
insightful research is essential in order to support and facilitate this
task. From the literature available, it can be assumed with certainty
that industries are currently making substantial efforts to ensure that
their manufacturing-related operations are as green and as sustainable
as possible. The literature review contained in this paper endeavours to
assess, from a global perspective, the various challenges that hinder
these efforts while bearing in mind the positive trend in industrial
operations. It may also be worth noting that there are not much research

abstract = {The potential of additive manufacturing (AM) for distributed production is often mentioned as an enabler for sustainable manufacturing within a circular economy. Currently, even if manufacturing with AM is distributed, the used materials can rarely be acquired locally and are usually obtained from a centralized location. Addressing this issue, we are developing an approach that supports the search for local materials that are suitable as material input for AM and are recyclable to serve multiple product lifecycles. The approach is an iterative process consisting of four phases; “material in AM context”, “recycling opportunities”, “material property testing”, and “application possibilities”. As an initial example, we present a process to adapt mussel shell waste into AM material. Mussel shells are a voluminous waste stream in the Netherlands. The shells, which mainly exist of calcium carbonate, are ground into a powder and combined with sugar water. Using a modified material extrusion process, 3D objects are created. In this paper, we discuss the iterations through our approach and illustrate the initial 3D printed results. With this project, we intend to demonstrate the potential of using local waste streams for AM processes for a circular economy. This is a first step towards the development of a methodology for linking local material streams to novel AM processes and meaningful applications.},

In the process of solving environmental problem not only the role of large companies but also entrepreneurs has been noticed. Environmental entrepreneurship (otherwise referred to as “ecopreneurship”) can be defined as the process of entrepreneurship applied in order to create businesses that solve environmental problems or operate sustainably. Despite the growing interest in environmental entrepreneurship, the academic literature on the subject is still in a nascent stage which justifies carrying out analyses in this area. The purpose of the study is, through a bibliometric analysis, to reflect the status of the environmental entrepreneurship field, identify key research areas and establish future directions for research. The article presents previous literature studies and intend to fill the identified gap in terms of queries, databases, research period and methodology. In particular we applied H-Classics methodology and in-depth content analysis of 318 sample articles which has not been used in previous studies. The analysis led to identifying four research sub-areas of environmental entrepreneurship within the document sample. Directions of further research are such areas of exploration as factors influencing entrepreneurial actions (external e.g. institutional factors, internal – including psychological factors) and the importance of various entities in the development of sustainable entrepreneurship (which includes ecopreneurship). There is also the need to look at entrepreneurship from multiple scientific perspectives and the necessity to carry out research eliminating the limitations of previous research projects. Due to the fact that entrepreneurship is a dynamic phenomenon, it has been stressed on several occasions that there is a need for conducting longitudinal research.},

With gravimetric and spectroscopic methods determining cleaning performance index, superficial gas velocity, bed height, temperature, agitation speed and cleaning time were investigated to evaluate their influence on dry cleaning performance. Under the moderate operating conditions, the gravimetric and spectroscopic indexes of the dry cleaning reached up to 98.4{\%} and 95.0{\%}, which were close to those of routine caustic washing (99.2{\%} and 98.9{\%}). Furthermore, the dry cleaning turned in a similar performance by visual inspection, as well as a similar surface transition of more hydrophilicity compared with caustic washing. Mechanism analysis indicated that mutual interaction between fluidization and agitation facilitated adhesion breaking and dispersing of contaminants into gas-solid media due to sufficient collisions and mass transfer. Triboelectrification that resulted in redeposition of fine powder should be avoided to further improve dry cleaning performance. This study provides theoretical and practical guidance for dry cleaning of contaminated waste plastics.},

In theory, if we can help individuals and institutions to recognize the value of nature, then this should greatly increase investments in conservation, while at the same time fostering human well-being. In practice, however, we have not yet developed the scientific basis, nor the policy and finance mechanisms, for incorporating natural capital into resource- and land-use decisions on a large scale. Here, we propose a conceptual framework and sketch out a strategic plan for delivering on the promise of ecosystem services, drawing on emerging examples from Hawai'i.

abstract = {Fused deposition molding (FDM) is the most popular technology in the fields of three-dimensional printing, but it is hard to use a variety of plastic materials due to the limitation of filament form of material. Using plastic pellets as printing materials gives advantages in cost, processing speed, and available materials. In this work, a large-scale double-screw FDM three-dimensional printer based on plastic pellets has been designed. It is capable of printing large plastic products at a low cost and high speed. Using ABS+10{\%} GF as printing material, this work is first focused on the effects of the pressure and speed of the metering screw on the flowrate of melt. The equation for the relationship of these three parameters was established as well. Based on this equation, the effects of melt flow, printing speed, and layer thickness on the width of fused filament were investigated with experiments. Furthermore, the effects of printing spacing between fused filaments on surface accuracy and bonding strength were also explored. By printing models, it was revealed that the designed printer is able to print products with plastic pellets. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {In the product development process, companies require fast and inexpensive tooling to produce or evaluate components, enabling them to bring their products to market faster and more efficiently. Time to market directly influences the profitability of a new product. As timescales are reduced and risk levels rise, the demands on prototypes increase. Prototypes are needed faster, to be more accurate and more representative of the final component. Only the companies being first into the market can survive in this highly competitive marketplace. Business today requires everything faster. Additive manufacturing techniques are speeding up the availability of prototype parts. Additive manufacturing (AM) is an engineering tool to assist with changes and a means of improving communication and reducing risk. AM has the potential of creating short run and end-use tooling which can shorten the product development cycle significantly. The short lead time of AM tooling can significantly reduce cost and time to market. Hence, AM has enabled industry to benefit from different rapid tooling techniques such as investment casting, vacuum casting, metal spray tooling, and Keltool. Direct approaches to rapid tooling do not require the production of a pattern. Direct rapid tooling (DRT) involves no intermediate steps during the process of tool fabrication and potentially impact overall cost and part accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {? 2014, Springer-Verlag London.During surgical interventions where bone machining operations are involved (drilling, sawing, etc.), bone tissue may be damaged by the mechanical and thermal loads, and thus, working conditions should be selected in order to reduce or avoid this problem. In this study, with the purpose of reducing the damage induced when drilling, an analysis and improvement of the geometry of a surgical drill bit had been done. As baseline, a commercially available stainless steel surgical drill indicated for implant site preparation had been considered. The influence of the rake angle, margin width, and body thinning over the workpiece temperatures, cutting forces, and surface roughness has been determined by a sensitivity study. First, eight drill bits had been fabricated on hard metal and drilling tests on bovine femoral cortical bone were done. These tests showed that the rake angle is the most influential factor among the analyzed, both for temperatures and cutting efforts. The two drill designs which achieved the lowest workpiece temperatures, cutting forces, and surface roughness had been fabricated also in surgical stainless steel and tested at wider cutting condition range of cutting speed and feed rates. These two drill bits reduced workpiece temperatures about 50{\%}, feed force about 60{\%}, and cutting torque up to 50{\%}, while the surface roughness was improved significantly when compared with the commercial surgical drill bit at the same cutting conditions. Comparing stainless steel and hard metal drills, no appreciable effects of the tool material have been detected over the measured output variables. This study shows how remarkable improvements on the design of surgical drills could be achieved by defining the influence of the rake angle, margin width, and body thinning when drilling bone.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is fundamentally different from traditional formative or subtractive manufacturing in that it is the closest to the ‘bottom up' manufacturing where a structure can be built into its designed shape using a ‘layer-by-layer' approach rather than casting or forming by technologies such as forging or machining. AM is versatile, flexible, highly customizable and, as such, can suite most sectors of industrial production. Materials to make these parts/objects can be of a widely varying type. These include metallic, ceramic and polymeric materials along with combinations in the form of composites, hybrid, or functionally graded materials (FGMs). The challenge remains, however, to transfer this ‘making' shapes and structures into obtaining objects that are functional. A great deal of work is needed in AM in addressing the challenges related to its two key enabling technologies namely ‘materials' and ‘metrology' to achieve this functionality in a predictive and reproductive ways. The good news is that there is a significant interest in industry for taking up AM as one of the main production engineering route. Additive Manufacturing, in our opinion, is definitely at the cross-road from where this new, much-hyped but somewhat unproven manufacturing process must move towards a technology that can demonstrate the ability to produce real, innovative, complex and robust products.},

abstract = {The use and consumption of polymeric resins is growing around the world because they are easily formed, and can be used in a variety of applications. The increasing consumption results in a great environmental impact because the used plastics are discarded in nature in a non-rational form. Facing all these problems, recycling becomes a powerful strategy regarding the reduction of the environmental impact caused by plastic waste. In this work polymeric blends were prepared by mechanical recycling and characterized. LDPE/Al residues from cartooned packaging were blended with recycled HDPE/LDPE and virgin PE resins. It was observed that processability, mechanical properties, chemical resistance and water absorption are dependent on the blend compositions. Also, an aluminum film was found to remain as isolated particles in the polymeric matrix and the mechanical behavior of the blend depends on the aluminum dispersion. Either, the blend water absorption depends on recycled material contamination, mainly polyamides. Finally, the amount of recycled material added to the blends determines both chemical stability and thermal characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Most literature focuses on the quality at the end of the value chain while significant potential to improve the performance of the entire value chain is seen by the quality assessment of input material of recyclers. In this research a testing procedure for mixed plastic flakes by Fourier-Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and manual composition analysis assisted by computer vision. Mixed plastics from TV housings, washing machines, fridges and fridge drawers were taken as case studies. It is shown that unwanted plastic types, glass, metals, wood, rubber and foam as well as additives such as talc, calcium carbonate or brominated flame retardants can be detected by the procedure. In addition, a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is shown to be a powerful tool for a risk-based assessment of the most relevant quality influences, which allows to define strategies for quality control. The economic evaluation showed that automation is required to allow the systematic use of the testing procedure.},

Doing so calls attention to constructive elements and highlights the importance of studying the practice and the field, not only to derive best practices, but to understand how they work and to what potential consequences. We illustrate these ideas with a scenario development consulting project for an international infrastructure company in which we alter the method in three main places: scanning, interim scenario work and scenario development.

abstract = {Purpose ? This purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the steps and processes behind successfully adapting novel materials, namely virgin glass and recycled glass, to three?dimensional printing (3DP).Design/methodology/approach ? The transition from 3DP ceramic systems to glass systems will be examined in detail, including the necessary modifications to binder systems and printing parameters. The authors present preliminary engineering data on shrinkage, porosity, and density as functions of peak firing temperature, and provide a brief introduction to the complexities faced in realizing an adequate and repeatable firing method for 3D printed glass.Findings ? Shrinkage behavior for the 3D printed recycled glass showed significant anisotropy, especially beyond peak firing temperatures of 730°C. The average shrinkage ratios for the slow? and fast?axes to the Z?axis were 1:1.37 and 1:2.74, respectively. These extreme differences can be attributed to the layer?by?layer production method and binder burn?off. At 760°C, the apparent porosity reached a minimum of 0.36 percent, indicative of asymptotic behavior that approaches a fully dense 3DP glass specimen. At low firing temperatures, the bulk density was similar to water, but increased to a maximum of 2.41?g/cm3. This indicates that 3DP recycled glass can behave similarly to common glass with accepted published bulk densities ranging from 2.4?2.8?g/cm3.Research limitations/implications ? Heating schedule analysis and optimization may reduce geometric variations, therefore, the firing method should be investigated in greater depth.Originality/value ? This paper provides a guide to successfully adopting glass to commercially available 3DP hardware. This research has also enabled rapid prototyping of recycled glass, a monumental step towards a sustainable future for 3DP.},

We show how to program living slime mold machines by configurations of repelling and attracting gradients and demonstrate the workability of the living machines on tasks of computational geometry, logic, and arithmetic.},

abstract = {Past work has shown that particle material extrusion (fused particle fabrication (FPF)/fused granular fabrication (FGF)) has the potential for increasing the use of recycled polymers in 3D printing. This study extends this potential to high-performance (high-mechanical-strength and heat-resistant) polymers using polycarbonate (PC). Recycled PC regrind of approximately 25 mm2 was 3D printed with an open-source Gigabot X and analyzed. A temperature and nozzle velocity matrix was used to find useful printing parameters, and a print test was used to maximize the output for a two-temperature stage extruder for PC. ASTM type 4 tensile test geometries as well as ASTM-approved compression tests were used to determine the mechanical properties of PC and were compared with filament printing and the bulk virgin material. The results showed the tensile strength of parts manufactured from the recycled PC particles (64.9 MPa) were comparable to that of the commercial filament printed on desktop (62.2 MPa) and large-format (66.3 MPa) 3D printers. Three case study applications were investigated: (i) using PC as a rapid molding technology for lower melting point thermoplastics, (ii) printed parts for high temperature applications, and (iii) printed parts for high-strength applications. The results show that recycled PC particle-based 3D printing can produce high-strength and heat-resistant products at low costs.},

abstract = {This paper explores some a novel approaches to harnessing the Internet-of-Things (IoT) as a teaching and research vehicle in education. For teaching we argue that the Internet-of-Things provides a highly motivating topic to capture students' imaginations, and a perfect platform for teaching computer science. In addition, we explain the potential for entire campuses or buildings to be constructed from Internet-of-Things technologies and the potential for this infrastructure to act as a teaching platform. This proposition is perfectly captured by the axiom 'The college building (or campus) is the lab'. This philosophy is part of a wider movement that started in the EU, called Living Labs. In achieving these aims, our work seeks to combine a number of concepts, first we utilise the Internet-of-Things, second we incorporate Living Labs ideas, third we harness the iCampus vision, forth we use the 'Smart Box' concept and finally we implement the Pervasive-interactive-Programming (PiP) paradigm. We contend this approach can be used in various mixes to produce highly motivating and effective educational environments. We illustrate this work by describing the application of these ideas to a real-world venture, the Harlow UTC (in the UK). The main focus of this paper concerns the use of PiP, together with the Internet-of-Things, to teach elementary programming skills. In in support of this we present results of an evaluation of PiP with 18 participants (students and staff) of varied age and gender. The main conclusions of these evaluations were that PiP enabled students and staff, with diverse backgrounds, to quickly master the programming skills involved. The paper concludes by describing our future plans for this work. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Bibliometric methods of mapping technological trajectories encounter difficulty when identifying recent technological changes, mainly due to two forms of time lag: publication lag between invention and patent publication, and citation lag between publication and citation. To address this problem, we propose a novel way of identifying recent important publications, and of automatically connecting these to the patents-based main path. Our method reduces truncation bias due to publication and citation lags, and extends the technological trajectory to reach the latest technology at the research forefront. By generating links between patent and product, our approach can anticipate future product features that are driven by technological changes. In practice, our method enables managers to identify incremental innovation opportunities along mainstream technology dynamics, and further to detect signals of emerging technologies, wild cards, and new applications in other disciplines. An illustrative case regarding image technology is described and discussed.},

abstract = {In this study, a preliminary effort was undertaken to represent the mechanical properties of a 3D printed specimen as a function of layer number, thickness and raster orientation by investigating the correlation between the mechanical properties of parts manufactured out of ABS using Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) with a commercially available 3D printer, Makerbot Replicator 2x, and the printing parameters, such as layer thickness and raster orientation, were considered. Specimen were printed at raster orientation angles of 0°, 45° and 90°. Layer thickness of 0.2 mm was chosen to print specimens from a single layer to 35 layers. Samples were tested using an MTS Universal Testing Machine with extensometer to determine mechanical strength characteristics such as modulus of elasticity, ultimate tensile strength, maximum force and maximum elongation as the number of layers increased. Results showed that 0° raster orientation yields the highest mechanical properties compared to 45° and 90° at each individual layer. A linear relationship was found between the number of layers and the maximum force for all three orientations, in other words, maximum force required to break specimens linearly increased as the number of layers increased. The results also found the elastic modulus and maximum stress to increase as the number of layers increased up to almost 12 layers. For samples with more than 12 layers, the elastic modulus and maximum stress still increased, but at a much slower rate. These results can help software developers, mechanical designers and engineers reduce manufacturing time, material usage and cost by eliminating unnecessary layers that do not increase the ultimate stress of the material by improving material properties due to the addition of layers.},

abstract = {A range of methods are available for assessing ecosystem services. Methods differ in their aims; from mapping and modelling the supply and demand of ecosystem services to appraising their economic and non-economic importance through valuation techniques. Comprehensive guidance for the selection of appropriate ecosystem service assessment methods that address the requirements of different decision-making contexts is lacking. This paper tackles this gap using the experience from 27 case studies which applied different biophysical, socio-cultural and monetary valuation methods to operationalise the ecosystem service concept towards sustainable land, water and urban management. A survey of the reasons why the case study teams selected particular methods revealed that stakeholder-oriented reasons, such as stakeholder participation, inclusion of local knowledge and ease of communication, and decision-oriented reasons, such as the purpose of the case study and the ecosystem services at stake, were key considerations in selecting a method. Pragmatic reasons such as available data, resources and expertise were also important factors. This information was used to develop a set of linked decision trees, which aim to provide guidance to researchers and practitioners in choosing ecosystem service assessment methods that are suitable for their context.},

We argue that CWSs act as intermediaries between creative individuals (" the underground ") and innovative firms (" the upper-ground "), contributing to the interaction between co-located actors through the articulation of places, spaces, projects and events. The results lead to suggestions for policies to contribute to the emergence and development of innovation by fostering innovative pro-cesses outside firms.},

abstract = {Recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) aerogels are successfully developed using rPET fibers from plastic bottle wastes for oil spill cleaning applications. The rPET aerogels are formed via a freeze-drying process with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinking agents. After coating with methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS), the MTMS-coated rPET aerogels exhibit hydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 133°–141° for oil absorption applications. The effects of the rPET fiber concentrations, fiber deniers and cross-linker contents on the oil absorption performance of the rPET aerogels are comprehensively quantified. The 0.5 wt{\%} rPET aerogels show the largest oil absorption capacity of 79.4 g/g, approximately 7.0 and 3.2 times better than commercial sorbents, polypropylene pads and polypyrrole sponges, respectively and slightly larger than 0.5 wt{\%} cellulose-based aerogels from paper waste. From the oil absorption kinetics of the rPET aerogels quantified by the pseudo-first and pseudo–second order models, the 0.5 wt{\%} rPET aerogels can absorb oil up to 3.0 times faster than cellulose-based aerogels. In addition, rPET aerogels are also demonstrated to have a good absorption capacity for different organic solvents. These establish the novelty of the contribution and demonstrate that rPET aerogels can be promising materials for absorption applications due to their high absorption capacities, environmental-friendly and cost-effective fabrication method.},

To assist in this aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware. First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3-D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97{\%}, with some components representing only 1{\%} of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development enables a much broader audience to participate in optical experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous proprietary methods.},

abstract = {Plastics have been a necessary evil in our society for many years. Due to their strength, flexibility and low density, they provide huge savings in material and transport costs for suppliers of consumer products. For many applications, they are irreplaceable and their use has become the norm. In the past, we have relied on China but, in 2018, China has requested that plastics be over 99{\%} pure, as would be necessary for individual polymers to be recycled or reused effectively. With mixed waste plastics and the new categories of multi-component and laminated plastics, it makes recycling extremely difficult, costing more to the environment than making plastics from gas or crude. The last option, which is landfilling, is a waste of valuable fossil fuels and precious resources. Moreover, landfills, which are paid on the weight of materials, see their bottom-line adversely affected by plastic's low weight and long degradation times (100+ years). Enter, Surface-Flash-Cracking (SFC). Proven in the oil industry, SFC is ultrafast pyrolysis and, contrary to “slow” pyrolysis and gasification, is an order of magnitude more efficient and capable of producing high-quality ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) from even the most problematic waste plastics with high profitability and low environmental cost. For the same fuel, SFC emits 5 times less GHGs than crude refineries. SFC treats plastics by projecting small droplets onto very hot surfaces. They react almost instantly and produce vapors which are quickly swept out of the reactor. Each drop absorbs only the amount of energy needed to crack, preventing over-cracking and producing right-sized hydrocarbons which can be sorted with a distillation column into pure marketable fuels. Contrary to other plastic pyrolysis reactors, SFC optimizes solid-vapor separation and minimizes fouling of equipment. The technology is profitable and environmentally friendly, even at small scales. Operational costs are low and the value added to the plastics is much higher than by cleaning and sorting of solids polymers. Units are highly automated and get their energy from less than 10{\%} of the energy in the plastics. The rest becomes useful products, mostly high quality ULSD. Although bigger units would exponentially increase profits and efficiency, we believe small units are more environmentally friendly, as it greatly reduces GHGs associated with the inefficient transportation of light materials (plastics). The plastic China crisis is not a problem, but an opportunity to innovate and invest in new technologies such as SFC.},

abstract = {Today, the research on the closed-loop supply chain network design with sustainability and resiliency criteria is a very active research topic. This paper provides a new closed-loop supply chain under uncertainty with the use of resiliency, sustainability, and reliability dimensions among the first studies. To model this problem, a two-stage stochastic programming approach is used. To create robust solutions against uncertainty, a conditional value at risk criterion is contributed. The proposed model aims to minimize the total cost, environmental pollution, and energy consumption while maximizing the job opportunities as the social factor. In addition to the sustainability goals, the energy consumption is considered to be the last objective to be minimized. To show the applicability of the proposed model, an automobile assembler industry is applied. To solve the model, the Lp-metric method is employed to transform this multi-objective model into a single objective one. Since this closed-loop supply chain model is complex and NP-hard, a Lagrangian relaxation method with fix-and-optimize heuristic is employed to find the upper and lower bounds for the model via different random test problems. With an extensive analysis, the proposed model shows an improvement to the total cost, CO2 emissions, job opportunities and energy consumption.},

abstract = {Review: Recently the critical discussion about the preservation of natural resources and recycling has led to the renewed interest concerning biomaterials with the focus on renewable raw materials. Because of increasing environmental consciousness and demands of legislative authorities, use and removal of traditional composite structures, usually made of glass, carbon or aramid fibers being reinforced with epoxy, unsaturated polyester, or phenolics, are considered critically. Recent advances in natural fiber development, genetic engineering and composite science offer significant opportunities for improved materials from renewable resources with enhanced support for global sustainability. The important feature of composite materials is that they can be designed and tailored to meet different requirements. Since natural fibers are cheap and biodegradable, the biodegradable composites from biofibers and biodegradable polymers will render a contribution in the 21st century due to serious environmental problem. Biodegradable polymers have offered scientists a possible solution to waste-disposal problems associated with traditional petroleum-derived plastics. For scientists the real challenge lies in finding applications which would consume sufficiently large quantities of these materials to lead price reduction, allowing biodegradable polymers to compete economically in the market. Today's much better performance of traditional plastics are the outcome of continued R{\&}D efforts of last several years; however the existing biodegradable polymers came to public only few years back. Prices of biodegradable polymers can be reduced on mass scale production; and such mass scale production will be feasible through constant R{\&}D efforts of scientists to improve the performance of biodegradable plastics. Manufacture of biodegradable composites from such biodegradable plastics will enhance the demand of such materials. The structural aspects and properties of several biofibers and biodegradable polymers, recent developments of different biodegradable polymers and biocomposites are discussed in this review article. Collaborative R{\&}D efforts among material scientists and engineers as well as intensive co-operation and co-ordination among industries, research institutions and government are essential to find various commercial applications of biocomposites even beyond to our imagination.},

abstract = {Continuous Fibre Reinforced Thermoplastic Composites (CFRTPCs) are becoming alternative materials to replace the conventional thermosetting polymers and metals due to excellent mechanical performance, recycling and potential used in lightweight structures. Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a promising additive manufacturing technology and an alternative of conventional processes for the fabrication of CFRTPCs due to its ability to build functional parts having complex geometries. The mechanical properties of a built part depend on several process parameters. The aim of this study is to characterize the effect of build orientation, layer thickness and fibre volume content on the mechanical performance of 3D printed continuous fibre reinforced composites components manufactured by a desktop 3D printer. Tensile and three-point bending tests are carried out to determine the mechanical response of the printed specimens. SEM images of fractured surfaces are evaluated to determine the effects of process parameters on failure modes. It is observed that the effect of layer thickness of nylon samples on the mechanical performance is marginally significant. In addition, continuous fibre reinforced samples show higher strength and stiffness values than unreinforced ones. The results show that carbon fibre reinforced composites exhibit the best mechanical performance with higher stiffness and flat samples exhibit higher values of strength and stiffness than on-edge samples. Additionally, the results show that strength and stiffness increase as fibre volume content increases in most cases but, conversely, the level of increment in mechanical performance is moderate with continued rise in fibre content, particularly in the case of Kevlar{\textregistered} and glass fibres, due to weak bonding between the fibre/nylon layers as well as the presence of increased levels of defects. Finally, the practicality of the results is assessed by testing an evaluation structure.},

Data from a representative sample of respondents in large urban areas (n = 2004) was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results of the SEM analysis showed a good fit of the survey data to the Theory of Planned Behavior theoretical model. The Theory of Planned Behavior explains 26.4{\%} of the variance in recycling behavior and 46.4{\%} of the variance in intention to recycle. Only 3.3{\%} of South Africans in large urban areas show dedicated recycling behavior, considering the recycling of five materials: paper, plastic, glass, metal, and compostable organic waste. The recycling frequency item in the recycling behavior construct is the most likely to be over-reported. South Africans lack sufficient knowledge, positive attitudes, social pressure, and perceived control that would encourage recycling behavior. Awareness drives containing moral values (injunctive norms) and information about available recycling schemes, combined with the provision of a curbside collection service for recyclables, have the greatest chance to positively influence recycling behavior amongst South Africa's city dwellers.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors influencing recycling behaviour can lead to better and more effective recycling programs in a community. The goal of this study was to examine factors associated with household waste behaviours in the context of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) among a community sample of Iranians that included data collection at time 1 and at follow-up one year later at time 2. Study participants were sampled from households under the coverage of eight urban health centers in the city of Qazvin. Of 2000 invited households, 1782 agreed to participate in the study. A self-reported questionnaire was used for assessing socio-demographic factors and the TPB constructs (i.e. attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, and intention). Furthermore, questions regarding moral obligation, self-identity, action planning, and past recycling behaviour were asked, creating an extended TPB. At time 2, participants were asked to complete a follow-up questionnaire on self-reported recycling behaviours. All TPB constructs had positive and significant correlations with each other. Recycling behaviour at time 1 (past behaviour) significantly related to household waste behaviour at time 2. The extended TPB explained 47{\%} of the variance in household waste behaviour at time 2. Attitude, perceived behavioural control, intention, moral obligation, self-identity, action planning, and past recycling behaviour were significant predictors of household waste behaviour at time 2 in all models. The fact that the expanded TPB constructs significantly predicted household waste behaviours holds great promise for developing effective public campaigns and behaviour-changing interventions in a region where overall rates of household waste reduction behaviours are low. Our results indicate that educational materials which target moral obligation and action planning may be particularly effective. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The effects of reprocessing cycles on the structure and properties of isotactic polypropylene (PP)/Cloisite 15A (OMMT) (5 wt. {\%}) nanocomposites was studied in presence of maleic anhydride-grafted-polypropylene (PP-g-MA) (20 wt. {\%}) used as the compatibiliser to improve the clay dispersion in the polymer matrix. The various nanocomposite samples were prepared by direct melt intercalation in an internal mixer, and further they were subjected to 4 reprocessing cycles. For comparative purposes, the neat PP was also processed under the same conditions. The nanocomposite structure and the clay dispersion have been characterized by wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and rheological measurements. Other characterization techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), tensile measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) have also been used to evaluate the property changes induced by reprocessing. The study showed through XRD patterns that the repetitive reprocessing cycles modified the initial morphology of PP/OMMT nanocomposites by improving the formation of intercalated structure, especially after the fourth cycle. Further, the addition of PP-g-MA promoted the development of intercalated/exfoliated silicate layers in the PP matrix after the second cycle. These results are in agreement with TEM observations indicating an improved silicate dispersion in the polymer matrix with reprocessing cycles displaying a morphology with both intercalated/exfoliated structures. The initial storage modulus (G???) of the nanocomposites, which was highly improved in presence of PP-g-MA seems to be less affected by reprocessing cycles at very low frequencies exhibiting a quasi-plateau compared to pristine PP/OMMT and PP. In contrast, the complex viscosity was found to decrease for the whole samples indicating that the main effect of reprocessing was a decrease in the molecular weight. Moreover, the thermal and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were significantly reduced after the first cycle; nevertheless they remained almost unchanged during recycling. No change in the chemical structure was observed in the FT-IR spectra for both the nanocomposites and neat PP samples after 4 cycles. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The paper analyses the findings of a pilot study, conducted with the intention to see whether ordinary citizens from different countries could highlight problems which really could bring forth ideas for innovative products or services. The data were collected via electronic survey with the further qualitative content analyses of the problems that, to the respondents' minds, are worth solving. The expert group analysis of the ideas which derived from the problems was conducted to decide the feasibility of the approach, whose efficiency was concluded not to be high.

Biomass-derived poly(ethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PEF) has been used for fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing. A complete cycle from cellulose to the printed object has been performed. The printed PEF objects created in the present study show higher chemical resistance than objects printed with commonly available materials (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PETG)). The studied PEF polymer has shown key advantages for 3D printing: optimal adhesion, thermoplasticity, lack of delamination and low heat shrinkage. The high thermal stability of PEF and relatively low temperature that is necessary for extrusion are optimal for recycling printed objects and minimizing waste. Several successive cycles of 3D printing and recycling were successfully shown. The suggested approach for extending additive manufacturing to carbon-neutral materials opens a new direction in the field of sustainable development.},

abstract = {In an accurate and timely manner, capturing the risk signals for a specific emerging technology from academic publications is important to facilitate risk governance and to reduce the potential negative impact on socioeconomic systems. In the past decade, three-dimensional printing (3D printing) has become a promising emerging technology. To identify the relevant research on risk analysis for 3D printing, ''term clumping'' on ''risk analysis'' is explored using a quantitative method, and an integrated framework for risk identification is proposed with regard to 3D printing. This method involves a variation of TF*IDF and several new metrics for a Boolean query of the literature. The empirical results for the risk analysis studies of 3D printing show that, to date, very little attention has been paid to the relevant topics. However, although the risk signals of 3D printing are still weak and dispersed in many different categories, the potential threats to human health, cyber-security, and the environment are revealed in some facets. This enables initiation of strategies for anticipatory governance, involving science and technology policies and regulations.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd The wind energy industry is one of the fastest-growing application sectors of composites, where reinforcement fibers are used in the manufacturing of light rotor blades. Considering the limited lifetime of turbine blades, a growing number of wind turbines will start to be decommissioned. Turbine blades are generally landfilled at their end-of-life, which highly impacts the environment. This paper proposes a systematic scheme combining mechanical recycling and 3D printing to recycle the valuable constituents of the scrap blades and reuse them in a Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process with the aim of improving the mechanical performance of 3D printed components. Mechanical grinding integrated with a double sieving mechanism is utilized to recover the reinforcement fibers. Tensile test specimens with 5 wt{\%} fiber content are fabricated from the recycled fibers and plastic pellets and their mechanical properties as well as internal microstructure are investigated. The results demonstrate an improvement of 16{\%} and 10{\%} in the elastic modulus and ultimate strength of the reinforced composite filament as compared to the commercially available pure PLA filament. As well, a Young's modulus of 3.35 GPa was observed for the FFF fabricated samples, which is an 8{\%} increase relative to pure PLA samples.},

abstract = {To fabricate highly complex structures, sacrificial support material is usually needed. However, traditional petroleum-based support materials are un-sustainable, non-recyclable, and difficult to be completely removed from the target structure after 3D processing. Instead, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) gel could serves as an interesting 3D printing support material due to its sustainability, renewability, and potential recyclability. Since CNCs are highly dispersible in water as nanoparticles and are also not UV sensitive, it has less absorption or bondability with other UV curable polymer matrices. This allows them to be completely washed out by water, which offers a green and efficient method to remove the CNC support material during post processing. In addition, with increasing needs for more intricate structures, combining different 3D printing strategies into a hybrid 3D printing platform can be highly beneficial. In this work, a multi-materials-multi-methods (M4) printer with dual direct-ink-write (DIW) and DIW-inkjet printing capability was used to fabricate various complex structures while using CNC as support material. After 3D printing, water was used to remove the CNC support structure. Even in a highly confined environment, such as the inside of a balloon structure, CNC support material was still easily removed. The potential of using sustainable CNC support material and M4 hybrid 3D printing strategies to fabricate different complex structures was demonstrated. Since CNC gel is derived from forestry products and is entirely water based, the 3D printing process was also made more environmentally friendly, sustainable, and potentially recyclable.},

Therefore, it challenges companies to reinvent their business model-describing the logic of creating and capturing value. In this paper, we explore the implications that AM technologies have for manufacturing systems in the new business models that they enable. In particular, we consider how a consumer goods manufacturer can organize the operations of a more open business model when moving from a manufacturer-centric to a consumer-centric value logic. A major shift includes a move from centralized to decentralized supply chains, where consumer goods manufacturers can implement a "hybrid" approachwith a focus on localization and accessibility or develop a fully personalizedmodel where the consumer effectively takes over the productive activities of the manufacturer.We discuss some of the main implications for research and practice of consumer-centric business models and the changing decoupling point in consumer goods' manufacturing supply chains.},

abstract = {Abstract A questionnaire survey consisting of 2400 householders was performed on Abadan residents to evaluate their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards solid waste (SW) reduction, source separation and recycling, collection and willingness to pay (WTP) for SW services. The study has also covered the relationship between demographic variables and KAP towards SW management. The data analyzed suggests that the studied community had a very positive attitude to take part in SW source separation and recycling plans. However, the respondents not only showed low intimate knowledge of different steps of SW management, but were also weak to take practices about these steps. The KAP of SW source separation and recycling was influenced by demographic factors of age, education level, gender and occupation. It was further found that education level and occupation were two significant factors affecting residents' WTP ($\chi${\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 24.083, p-value {\textless}0.0001). In conclusion our study found that providing public with MSW infrastructures and improving citizens' awareness about SW source separation and recycling to promote SW recycling programs hold great promise for developing effective public campaigns and behavior-changing interventions. This has important implications in that the usual KAP of public proved inadequate in the case of SW source separation and recycling. The implementation of needs-based training programmes considering females as one of the main audience groups and determination of municipality needs are thereby highly advocated.},

abstract = {Multilayer plastic films provide a range of properties, which cannot be obtained from monolayer films but, at present, their recyclability is an open issue and should be improved. Research to date has shown the possibility of using whey protein as a layer material with the property of acting as an excellent barrier against oxygen and moisture, replacing petrochemical non-recyclable materials. The innovative approach of the present research was to achieve the recyclability of the substrate films by separating them, with a simple process compatible with industrial procedures, in order to promote recycling processes leading to obtain high value products that will beneficially impact the packaging and food industries. Hence, polyethyleneterephthalate (PET)/polyethylene (PE) multi-layer film was prepared based on PET coated with a whey protein layer, and then the previous structure was laminated with PE. Whey proteins, constituting the coating, can be degraded by enzymes so that the coating films can be washed offfrom the plastic substrate layer. Enzyme types, dosage, time, and temperature optima, which are compatible with procedures adopted in industrial waste recycling, were determined for a highly-efficient process. The washing of samples based on PET/whey and PET/whey/PE were efficient when performed with enzymatic detergent containing protease enzymes, as an alternative to conventional detergents used in recycling facilities. Different types of enzymatic detergents tested presented positive results in removing the protein layer from the PET substrate and from the PET/whey/PE multilayer films at room temperature. These results attested to the possibility of organizing the pre-treatment of the whey-based multilayer film by washing with different available commercial enzymatic detergents in order to separate PET and PE, thus allowing a better recycling of the two different polymers. Mechanical properties of the plastic substrate, such as stress at yield, stress and elongation at break, evaluated by tensile testing on films before and after cleaning, were are not significantly affected by washing with enzymatic detergents.},

Accounting for energy use in China, 1980-94. Energy 1998;23:835-49, the main factors that influence the changes in energy-related CO2 emissions are analysed. The study refers to the period 1998-2006, split into two time intervals (1998-2002 and 2002-2006) and considers four explanatory factors: CO2 intensity, energy intensity, structural changes and economic activity. The importance of sectoral dimension is taken into account by dividing the Italian economy into five main sectors: the agricultural; the industrial; the electricity and heat production, water and gas; the transport and the services sectors. An industrial sub-sector decomposition analysis is also performed by considering six industrial branches. It is found that, during the period considered, the Italian economy did not perform absolute decoupling in terms of energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions and that economic growth and energy intensity are the largest contributors to CO2 emissions increase. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Environmental decision- and policy-making must contend with uncertainty about the future that can hinder proactive environmental decisions, forcing environmental managers into reactive postures. To help prevent this, a variety of methods exist for exploring potential environmental futures and associated uncertainties. Producing environmental futures benefits those involved by supporting a systems-level understanding and expanding thinking beyond “business as usual”. We review select environmental and non-environmental futures programs that seek to inform decision-making. Review objectives are to: 1) identify and discuss key environmental futures program attributes, and 2) propose program attributes that support successful connection with decision processes. Attributes discussed include purpose and audience, methods, addressing uncertainty and assumptions, relationship to indicator programs, how program values and biases are addressed, the role of goals, and how success is measured and defined. We conclude with recommendations for how to conduct environmental futures programs to be more useful for environmental decisions. These include: combining multiple environmental futures methods to provide complementary insights or highlight inconsistencies in assumptions, including a schematic of assumptions and drivers, and defining success criteria, whenever possible. These practices can help increase the acceptance of environmental futures products in decision-making and increase their short-term and long-term contributions.},

abstract = {For the first time, low-cost open-source 3-D printing provides the potential for distributed manufacturing at the household scale of customized, high-value, and complex products. To explore the potential of this type of ultra-distributed manufacturing, which has been shown to reduce environmental impact compared to conventional manufacturing, this paper presents a case study of a 3-D printable parametric design for recreational vehicle (RV) solar photovoltaic (PV) racking systems. The design is a four-corner mounting device with the ability to customize the tilt angle and height of the standoff. This enables performance optimization of the PV system for a given latitude, which is variable as RVs are geographically mobile. The open-source 3-D printable designs are fabricated and analyzed for print time, print electricity consumption, mechanical properties, and economic costs. The preliminary results show distributed manufacturing of the case study product results in an order of magnitude reduction in economic cost for equivalent products. In addition, these cost savings are maintained while improving the functionality of the racking system. The additional electrical output for a case study RV PV system with improved tilt angle functionality in three representative locations in the U.S. was found to be on average over 20{\%} higher than that for conventional mass-manufactured racking systems. The preliminary results make it clear that distributed manufacturing -even at the household level -with open-source 3-D printers is technically viable and economically beneficial. Further research is needed to expand the results of this preliminary study to other types of products.},

Therefore, unsintered powder can be recovered and recycled in subsequent builds to significantly decrease net costs. To improve blending protocols, the powder quality, i.e. the degree of degradation, was quantified using differential scanning calorimetry. Contrary to the work of others, the results suggested that the sensitivity of differential scanning calorimetry to small changes in molecular weight could reproducibly detect small changes in ovenaged (degraded) powder.},

abstract = {The emergence of advanced manufacturing technologies, coupled with consumer demands for more customised products and services, are causing shifts in the scale and distribution of manufacturing. In this paper, consideration is given to the role of one such advanced manufacturing process technology: additive manufacturing. The consequences of adopting this novel production technology on industrial sustainability are not well understood and this exploratory study draws on publically available data to provide insights into the impacts of additive manufacturing on sustainability. Benefits are found to exist across the product and material life cycles through product and process redesign, improvements to material input processing, make-to-order component and product manufacturing, and closing the loop.

@article{Mulholland2019,
abstract = {Recently, the concept of social value in construction has seen increasing policy, practice and research interest. In part, this interest stems from growing recognition that construction projects, and especially megaprojects, can create huge social impacts. Although many studies have focussed on defining and developing measures for quantifying social value, qualitative meanings and interpretations of these measures are relatively under-examined. In this paper, two instrumental case studies of infrastructure megaprojects in nuclear decommissioning are analysed to investigate the process of meaning-making of social value. Lessons are drawn from taking a more qualitative, dynamic and processual approach. The findings highlight the limitations of reductionism in existing quantitative measures and emphasise the importance of time and place in understanding the ever-changing idea (and ideals) of delivering social value. Social value is thus a condition of, and conditioned by, ongoing negotiations throughout the lifecycle. Adding to social value research that is dominated by quantitative studies, the nuances highlighted in the case studies show the need to move beyond static measures at a point in time to consider the ongoing and never-ceasing process of transforming social value in construction.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore the potential positive effects of the design of a physical organisational environment on the emergence of an organisational culture conducive to organisational creativity. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on an in-depth, longitudinal case study, the aim being to enhance understanding of how a change in physical space, including location, spatial organisation and architectonic details, supports cultural change. Findings - It is suggested that physical space plays an implicit yet significant role in the emergence of a culture conducive to organisational creativity. It appears from the case analysis that there are three aspects of culture in particular, equality, openness and collectivity, that may be positively affected by the design of an organisation's physical environment. Practical implications - The careful choice, planning and design of an organisation's physical location, layout and style can advance the appearance of an organisational culture conducive to creativity. Originality/value - The paper describes a longitudinal study comparing a case organisation before and after a change in its physical environment. The longitudinal data illustrates how a change in the spatial environment contributes to the emergence of a culture conducive to organisational creativity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Nowadays the smart-city concept is shifting from a top- down, mere technological approach towards bottom-up processes that are based on the participation of creative citizens, research organisations and companies. Here, the city acts as an urban innovation ecosystem in which smart applications, open government data and new modes of participation are fostering innovation in the city. However, detailed analyses on how to manage smart city initiatives as well as descriptions of underlying challenges and barriers seem still scarce. Therefore, this paper investigates four, collaborative smart city initiatives in Europe to learn how cities can optimize the citizen's involvement in the context of open innovation. The analytical framework focuses on the innovation ecosystem and the civic capacities to engage in the public domain. Findings show that public service delivery can be co-designed between the city and citizens, if different toolkits aligned with the specific capacities and skills of the users are provided. By providing the right tools, even ordinary citizens can take a much more active role in the evolution of their cities and generate solutions from which both the city and everyday urban life can possibly benefit.},

To facilitate product development decisions, a reference system is shown describing the key attributes of a product from a manufacturability stand- point: complexity, customization, and production volume. Complexity and customization scales enable the grouping of products into regions of the map with common levels of the three attributes. A geometric complexity factor developed for cast parts is modified for a more general application. Parts with varying geometric complexity are then analyzed and mapped into regions of the complexity, customization, and production volume model. A discrete set of customization levels are also introduced. Implications for product development and manufacturing business approaches are discussed},

abstract = {In this paper, we show how various authors have discussed the idea of sustainability and linked it to ethics and ethical behaviour. We further show that ideas of sustainability are closely linked to the notion of sameness through time. We discuss sameness in an object-predicate framework and show that in this context, it requires selecting clear criteria, with behaviours adopted to meet those criteria. An important insight from the object-predicate framework is that selection of the criteria for sameness is shown to rest entirely on the value judgements of those making the selection. We provide a detailed example that demonstrates this, and argue that given the prominence of value judgements in assessments of sameness (and in this sense, of sustainability), ethics are unavoidably at its foundation. Examining ideas of sustainability in this way may provide insights into how we might become better able to meet the conception of sustainable development articulated in the Brundtland Report.},

The set-up of such offices is known to be an effective tool in supporting the implementation of sustainability initiatives on campuses, and in fostering awareness among students and staff on matters related to sustainable development. But despite their usefulness and proven effectiveness, the use of Green Offices and Sustainability Offices is not as wide as it could -or should-be. Also, there is a limited amount of empirical international work performed to date, which have investigated the various barriers related to their works. This paper, which focus on the role played by green offices in a higher education context, addresses a research gap. On the basis of the need to address this research gap, this paper presents the results of an international study on Green and Sustainability Offices, performed with a sample of 70 higher education institutions from round the world. The study consisted of an on-line survey which identified the extent to which Green Offices or similar governance structures are being deployed, some specific aspects of their operations and the barriers or difficulties related to their activities. The study concludes by suggesting some topics higher education institutions may take into consideration, in order to maximise their potential benefits.},

abstract = {Due to an increase in the number of applications for 3D printers, the use of thermoplastic resins such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and poly lactic acid (PLA), which are typical filament materials for fused filament fabrication (FFF) type 3D printers, has also increased significantly. This trend has produced an interest in recycled filaments, both to reduce the manufacturing cost of fabricated products and to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Also, this recycling system is very useful to make functional filament such as highly conducting or high strength filament by combining carbon nanotube or polydopamine during recycling process. This study presents the design procedures of system for making recycled filaments for 3D printers from waste polymer. The system integrates four main parts for recycling filament: a shredder, which crushes polymer waste into small pieces; an extruder, which extrudes filament from the crushed pieces; a sensing and control component, which regulates the diameter of the extruded filament via a closed-loop control system, and a spooler. Additionally, the dimensional accuracy, the mechanical strength of pristine, and recycled filaments were investigated and compared.},

Interviews with 13 top-managers were analyzed using a grounded theory approach to allow the process to emerge. The findings confirmed earlier conclusions on perceptual filters that reduce the number and type of signals assessed. Contrary to earlier findings, the process was significantly altered to compensate for this loss in two ways. First, managers deliberately postponed their assessment of a weak signal by discussing it with people with distinct and second, some managers deliberately searched for signals that were unfamiliar and not fitting their mental model. The sample consisted of outperforming top managers, which raised questions about the generalizability of the findings in specific directions: are the alterations in the weak signal process exemplary for outperformers only, and how does its success compare to formal foresight methods. Finally, the findings have managerial relevance since they indicate how to detect and bring weak signals into the company before impact.},

@article{Iakovou2010,
abstract = {The development of renewable energy sources has clearly emerged as a promising policy towards enhancing the fragile global energy system with its limited fossil fuel resources, as well as for reducing the related environmental problems. In this context, waste biomass utilization has emerged as a viable alternative for energy production, encompassing a wide range of potential thermochemical, physicochemical and bio-chemical processes. Two significant bottlenecks that hinder the increased biomass utilization for energy production are the cost and complexity of its logistics operations. In this manuscript, we present a critical synthesis of the relative state-of-the-art literature as this applies to all stakeholders involved in the design and management of waste biomass supply chains (WBSCs). We begin by presenting the generic system components and then the unique characteristics of WBSCs that differentiate them from traditional supply chains. We proceed by discussing state-of-the-art energy conversion technologies along with the resulting classification of all relevant literature. We then recognize the natural hierarchy of the decision-making process for the design and planning of WBSCs and provide a taxonomy of all research efforts as these are mapped on the relevant strategic, tactical and operational levels of the hierarchy. Our critical synthesis demonstrates that biomass-to-energy production is a rapidly evolving research field focusing mainly on biomass-to-energy production technologies. However, very few studies address the critical supply chain management issues, and the ones that do that, focus mainly on (i) the assessment of the potential biomass and (ii) the allocation of biomass collection sites and energy production facilities. Our analysis further allows for the identification of gaps and overlaps in the existing literature, as well as of critical future research areas. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Sustainable Product-Service Systems are a promising approach based on a Triple Bottom Line perspective of the sustainability. However, its practical adoption is still very limited and addresses signiﬁcant barriers for the manufacturing firms. Furthermore, this emergent topic has been discussed by literature mainly in large company's context, turning in a very limited and immature stage the current body of knowledge for the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. Thus, considering the significance of small companies to the global economy and their intrinsic difficulties, the purpose of this study was to identify the main barriers involving the Sustainable Product-Service Systems transition in manufacturing Small and Medium-sized Enterprises as well as the strategies to overcome them. A systematic literature review of the past two decades was organized capturing the state-of-art of the area. Findings reveal that internal barriers associated with intrinsic characteristics of SMEs become still more sensitive during the transition (e.g., limited financial resources, the lack of competences, follower mentality and resistance to change). As well as, barriers related with the novelty of Sustainable Product-Service Systems models require new attitudes to small companies (e.g., changing mindsets from product ownership to use, replacing the value of exchange by value in use involving long-term relations, understanding the Product-Service Systems concept) and particularly highlight the lack of models/methods supporting this transition. The practical contribution of this study is in organise a comprehensive body of knowledge on strategies to overcome barriers towards Sustainable Product-Service offering. Moreover, an innovative decision matrix supporting decision-makers during the SPSS transition was developed from the literature review findings.},

More knowledge is also needed regarding how 3D Printing affects the competitive dynamics between firms. This article explores how 3D Printing has been adopted for manufacturing and discusses under what conditions it might influence competition in different industries. Drawing upon data from the global hearing aid industry's adoption of 3D Printing during the period 1989-2008, this paper describes some of the benefits of using the technology, while also pointing out challenges firms encounter in making this transition. The study shows that early adopters were exposed to more technological uncertainty related to choosing printers. All firms encountered operational challenges as 3D Printing required new skill sets, but the technology had little impact on the competitive dynamics of this industry. Drawing upon literature on technological discontinuities, platforms and ecosystems, the paper illustrates and explains why the technology was not disruptive and also discusses how these findings apply to other industrieswhere 3D Printing is currently gaining momentum.},

abstract = {Contradictory findings on the relationship between proactive environmental strategy and performance are reported in the existing literature. The way that proactive environmental strategy is defined, the omission of crucial mediating variables and the misfit between strategy and business structures may help explain these conflicting findings. Drawing upon the logic of strategy-action-performance, this study tests the effects of two implementation variables of proactive environmental strategy—green human resource management (GHRM) and environmental legitimacy (EL)—on environmental performance as well as the mediating roles played by the implementation of green operational practices (GOP). Further, based on contingency theory, this study proposes that the impacts of GHRM and EL on the implementation of GOP might be moderated by operational barriers (OB) and managerial barriers (MB). The proposed hypotheses are empirically tested using a dataset of 260 sample plants in 11 countries/regions (Finland, Sweden, Germany, Taiwan, Israel, Mainland China, Spain, Brazil, Italy, South Korea and Japan). The results show that the effect of GHRM on environmental performance is fully mediated by the implementation of GOP (the path coefficient b for the direct link between GHRM and environmental performance changes from 0.436, p {\textless} 0.001 to 0.180, p {\textgreater} 0.1). EL has no statistically significant direct or indirect effects on environmental performance (direct effect: b = −0.08, p {\textgreater} 0.1, indirect effect: b = 0.083, p {\textgreater} 0.1) but has a marginally significant effect on the implementation of GOP (b = 0.218, p {\textless} 0.1). The results also indicate that OB reduce the effectiveness of EL in facilitating the implementation of GOP (b = −0.103, p {\textless} 0.1), and MB reduce the effectiveness of GHRM in supporting the implementation of GOP (b = −0.11, p {\textless} 0.1).},

While different from polyolefin, Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC), along with many halogenated polymers, all belong to the same thermo-plastic group. Rigid plasticized PVC is commonly used in pipes, window framing, floor coverings, roofing sheets, and cables; thereby it is discarded at a high rate. Adopting an appropriate recycling pathway is of both an economic value and an environmental benefit. The high hydrogen chloride content and the concern of dioxins and furans emission deter its thermochemical conversion. Re-compounding, particularly, when it is generated at a substantial amount and at low variation in composition, is the ultimate recycling strategy. In this work, analysis of the composition of PVC waste stream from the cable industry is carried out. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) was conducted to infer the moisture, volatile, and inorganic filler fractions and the extent of thermal stability. These data are important to design the proper re-compounding, extrusion and injection conditions for the postconsumer PVC. Standard tensile and dynamic stress samples were produced and subjected to successive aging, extrusion and molding. Thermal properties were insignificantly altered, whereas mechanical properties lost some but tolerable flexibility. The results suggesting that PVC cable polymer can be reutilized in a close sustainable manufacturing which warrants ecological and economic benefit.},

Specifically, we investigate the linkages between sustainability transitions and degrowth. Based on a literature review of both degrowth and sustainability transitions, we distinguish several aspects that provide a common ground for both approaches. We identify degrowth as one of the most far-reaching forms of sustainability transitions but suggest that it would benefit from a more stringent conceptualization using the analytical framework of sustainability transitions. To this end, we apply some conceptual notions from sustainability transitions theory to describe the idea of a degrowth transition. In particular, we analyze two case studies of degrowth practices (Cargonomia and a Transition Towns network) using the analytical framework of transition experiments. Sustainability transitions analytical frameworks and conceptual notions proved to be helpful interpretative lenses for looking at degrowth, and they can help to systematically structure its main postulates.},

Prototyping is critical to the success of product development efforts, and yet its implementation in practice is often guided by ad hoc experience. To address this need, we seek to advance the study and development of prototyping principles, techniques, and tools. A method to repeatedly enhance the outcome of prototyping efforts is reported in this paper. The research methodology to develop this method is as follows: (1) systematically identify practices that improve prototyping; (2) synthesize these practices to form a guiding method for designers; and (3) validate that the proposed method encourages best practices and improves performance. Prototyping practices are represented as six key heuristics to guide a designer in planning: how many iterations to pursue, how many unique design concepts to explore in parallel, as well as the use of scaled prototypes, isolated subsystem prototypes, relaxed requirements, and virtual prototypes. The method is correlated, through experimental investigation, with increased application of these best practices and improved design performance outcomes. These observations hold across various design problems studied. This method is novel in providing a systematic approach to prototyping.},

Learning and feeding back from existing experiences is therefore a fundamental step to ensure appropriate and useful support by ES science. This paper aims to gather and critically analyse how ES science contributes to spatial planning practices. Through a systematic review of the literature about ES use in spatial planning, we map the level of integration of ES knowledge, the scale of case studies, and the type of planning addressed; and we identify and analyse case studies of real-world applications. Studies explicitly aimed at supporting spatial planning have increased over the last decade, but are still scarce. The real-world case studies reveal advantages of integrating ES knowledge into spatial planning processes, mainly concerning practical aspects such as synthesizing complex socio-environmental information and promoting participation. Windows of opportunity offered by regulatory frameworks and innovative processes and instruments, such as marine spatial plans and strategic environmental assessments, are key factors triggering the integration. However, supportive contextual conditions are necessary, including science-policy collaborations across the entire planning process and environmental awareness among policy-makers and stakeholders.},

The set process parameters during FDM printing, affect the mechanical behaviour of the built part. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of variable infill density on the tensile and impact strength of polylactic acid (PLA) specimens printed by an open-source 3D printer. The tensile and impact test specimens are printed according to the DIN EN ISO 527-2, ASTM D256 (Izod) and ASTM D6110 (Charpy) respectively. A computerised tensometer and impactometer used to conduct the tensile and the impact strength of the PLA specimens. The tensile strength with the highest value of 46.3 N/mm2 and the lowest value of 29.9 N/mm2 are found. The results demonstrate that the specimens with varying infill density exhibit better tensile strength than the specimens with single infill density. The varying infill density specimens weigh lighter as compared to single infill density, which saves the raw material. The highest Charpy and lowest Izod strength found to be 4.72 kJ/m2 and 1.7 kJ/m2. The impact test experimental data establishes that impact strength is directly proportional to the infill density. Thus, by varying the infill density, there is a reduction in the impact strength of the printed specimens.},

While bioeconomic impact assessments exist, they usually focus on a particular sustainability dimension and on specific products or technologies. To draw a more holistic picture, this paper aims to analyze the substitution impacts of four bioeconomic innovations in terms of policy objectives as formulated by the EC. We estimated the indirect impacts resulting from a partial replacement of non-bio-based inputs with bio-based substitutes in the transport equipment, construction, textile, and chemical sectors. A multi-regional input-output (MRIO)-based approach was used to yield point estimates and uncertainty intervals. While our results point to a number of possible socioeconomic and environmental benefits, there is an astonishing diversity of outcomes across the scenarios with regard to their potentials and limitations to contribute to policy objectives. Decisions on future utilization paths of biomass will strongly influence the characteristics of an upcoming bioeconomy in terms of sustainability. Mere promotion of additional biomass use as a policy strategy is not sufficient to pursue the development of an effective bioeconomy capable to deliver “sustainable growth.”},

PGM reclamation is the major aim of recycling operations despite their minor concentration in spent auto-catalysts, which implies that the remaining materials are disposed of as unwanted solid waste after the extraction process. This poses a genuine challenge, as well as a motivation to develop recycling processes for spent auto-catalysts capable of recovering all components/valuable metals, while moderating environmental pollution and global warming. The focus herein involves the description of the available technologies, including pyro- and hydro-metallurgical processes, to recover PGMs from spent auto-catalysts, and specifically an analysis of the developmental trends in recycling methods to ensure “sustainable metallurgy”.},

abstract = {Circular Economy has undoubtedly become one of the hot topics in public debates about new and more sustainable industrial paradigms and strategies. In this respect, the fashion of Circular Economy is in the fact that it aims at overcoming the dominant linear take, make, disposal economy model, i.e. “a traditional open-ended economy model developed with no built-in tendency to recycle, which is reflected by treating the environment as a waste reservoir” (Su et al., 2013). Circular Economy, indeed, bases on the establishment of closed production systems, where resources are reused and kept in a loop of production and usage, allowing generating more value and for a longer period. Despite the interest for Circular Economy by politicians and practitioners, scholars, particularly in the strategic management field, are still struggling with a lack of a framework explaining how companies willing to become circular adapt their existing business model or create a new one. By extensively reviewing, through the lens of business model literature, the extant contributions on Circular Economy, we propose a taxonomy of Circular Economy Business Models based on the degree of adoption of circularity along two major dimensions: (i) the customer value proposition {\&} interface, i.e. the implementation of the circularity concept in proposing value to customers; (ii) the value network, i.e. the ways through which interacting with suppliers and reorganizing the own internal activities. The taxonomy is then initially tested through some explorative case studies, showing in practice the ability of the framework to properly distinguish different modes of adoption of Circular Economy.},

abstract = {Enhancing the resilience of ecosystem services (ES) that underpin human well-being is critical for meeting current and future societal needs, and requires specific governance and management policies. Using the literature, we identify seven generic policy-relevant principles for enhancing the resilience of desired ES in the face of disturbance and ongoing change in social-ecological systems (SES). These principles are (P1) maintain diversity and redundancy, (P2) manage connectivity, (P3) manage slow variables and feedbacks, (P4) foster an understanding of SES as complex adaptive systems (CAS), (P5) encourage learning and experimentation, (P6) broaden participation, and (P7) promote polycentric governance systems. We briefly define each principle, review how and when it enhances the resilience of ES, and conclude with major research gaps. In practice, the principles often co-occur and are highly interdependent. Key future needs are to better understand these interdependencies and to operationalize and apply the principles in different policy and management contexts. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright}2012 by Annual Reviews.

abstract = {Additive manufacturing is distinguished from traditional manufacturing techniques such as casting and machining by its ability to handle complex shapes with great design flexibility and without the typical waste. Although this technique has been mainly used for rapid prototyping, interest is growing in direct manufacture of actual parts. For wide spread application of 3D additive manufacturing, both techniques and feedstock materials require improvements to meet the mechanical requirements of load-bearing components. Here, we investigated short fiber (0.2-0.4. mm) reinforced acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene composites as a feedstock for 3D-printing in terms of their processibility, microstructure and mechanical performance. The additive components are also compared with traditional compression molded composites. The tensile strength and modulus of 3D-printed samples increased {\~{}}115{\%} and {\~{}}700{\%}, respectively. 3D-printing yielded samples with very high fiber orientation in the printing direction (up to 91.5{\%}), whereas, compression molding process yielded samples with significantly lower fiber orientation. Microstructure-mechanical property relationships revealed that although a relatively high porosity is observed in 3D-printed composites as compared to those produced by the conventional compression molding technique, they both exhibited comparable tensile strength and modulus. This phenomenon is explained based on the changes in fiber orientation, dispersion and void formation.},

abstract = {This study explores the potential to reach a circular economy for post-consumer Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (rPET) packaging and bottles by using it as a Distributed Recycling for Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) feedstock. Specifically, for the first time, rPET water bottle flake is processed using only an open source toolchain with Fused Particle Fabrication (FPF) or Fused Granular Fabrication (FGF) processing rather than first converting it to filament. In this study, first the impact of granulation, sifting, and heating (and their sequential combination) is quantified on the shape and size distribution of the rPET flakes. Then 3D printing tests were performed on the rPET flake with two different feed systems: an external feeder and feed tube augmented with a motorized auger screw, and an extruder-mounted hopper that enables direct 3D printing. Two Gigabot X machines were used, each with the different feed systems, and one without and the latter with extended part cooling. 3D print settings were optimized based on thermal characterization, and both systems were shown to 3D print rPET directly from shredded water bottles. Mechanical testing showed the importance of isolating rPET from moisture and that geometry was important for uniform extrusion. The mechanical strength of 3D-printed parts with FPF and inconsistent flow is lower than optimized fused filament, but adequate for a wide range of applications. Future work is needed to improve consistency and enable water bottles to be used as a widespread DRAM feedstock.},

abstract = {Businesses have practiced and examined lean and green manufacturing principles for the last 25 years, but the sustainability challenges that we face today are still significantly potent. This context creates a need to critically examine the research and practice in this domain to determine the gaps and propose solutions. To achieve that, we applied a two-tier analysis constituting bibliometric and content analyses for developing the intellectual structure of sustainable manufacturing (SM) literature. The study also produced a comprehensive framework to provide a granular understanding of SM literature. The framework demonstrates different paradigms of SM literature as well as the conceptual and methodological advancement of the research frontiers in the domain. The outcomes of the research comprise implications for researchers, managers, and policymakers. The study concludes that most empirical work focuses on the relationship of lean and green practices with organizational and environmental performance, but the role and criticality of sustainability are significantly underrepresented in SM literature. Based on our findings, we call for the integration of sustainability principles, that is, sustainable development goals (SDGs), circular economy, life cycle engineering, and corporate sustainability assessment with SM research.},

@article{Clayton2015,
abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is sensitive to powder variability when applying fine layers in a uniform manner. This demands a high degree of consistency and repeatability in the feedstock. Particle size is often used as a critical quality attribute, but this is not sufficient to fully qualify a feedstock. Indeed, it is inadequate to suggest that any parameter from a single test, e.g., Hall flowmeter or Hausner ratio, can comprehensively describe a powder's characteristics. This article uses four case studies to demonstrate the limitations of single parameter characterization and how the rheological properties of several metal powders used in AM applications are used to establish in-process performance. In the first study, the significantly reduced permeability and increased specific energy of a one batch of powder demonstrate a clear link to poor layer uniformity. The second study investigates the impact of metal powder manufacturing methods and suppliers, and it shows how shear properties alone cannot be relied on to identify properties that influence the process. The effect of additives on the processability of polymer blends used in AM is also evaluated, and the results show that even small quantities can have a significant effect on the permeability and basic flowability energy of feedstocks. The final study demonstrates the how rheological measurements can be used to identify the optimum blend of fresh and used material when reusing metal powders to manufacture components. These case studies illustrate the ability of a modern powder rheometer to detect minor variations in powders that are directly relevant to performance in AM processes in a way that traditional characterization methods cannot. {\textcopyright} 2015, The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society.},

abstract = {In this research, mechanical and structural properties of Continuous Fiber Reinforced Additively Manufactured (CFRAM) components are studied. Structural analysis is performed to understand the failure behavior of CFRAM components. Based on the SEM analysis of the tested parts, correlations between results of the mechanical test and microstructure of the parts have been investigated. CFRAM components are lightweight yet strong materials with a wide range of potential applications in auto industry, aerospace, sport goods, and medical tools. CFRAM components benefit from both cutting-edge 3D printing technology and fiber reinforcement to improve mechanical properties. Produced parts have lightweight compared with metals, strong mechanical properties, and short manufacturing time. In addition, thermoplastic polymer used for CFRAM components makes product recyclable. In this study, samples were printed using Markforged Mark Two printer and the effect of the fiber type, fiber orientations, infill density, and temperatures on tensile, fatigue, and creep properties were investigated. Carbon fiber (CF), fiberglass (FG), and Kevlar were used as reinforcing agents, and nylon as the base material. Microstructural analysis was conducted to investigate the fracture mechanism, morphology, and printing quality of the specimens. It was observed that the main failing mechanisms for CFRAM components are fiber pull-out, fiber breakage, and delamination. Further, it was understood that there is a correlation between the fiber stacking density and mechanical properties. Overall, the information provided in this study reports a unique knowledge base about the mechanical and structural behaviours of the components built with the CFRAM technology.},

abstract = {Many factors such as fossil resource scarcity and new technological developments have brought the bioeconomy, an economy based on the use of biomass or bio-based processes, into the focus. Although many authors and national strategies view bioeconomy innovations as a key for a sustainable economy transition, a conceptual framework that describes innovation types (ITs) in the bioeconomy profoundly is lacking, thus challenging the successful development of technology and innovation management (TIM) strategies and research. Against this backdrop, we aim to fill this gap by conceptualizing four ITs specific to the bioeconomy, namely I) Substitute Products, II) New (bio-based) Processes, III) New (bio-based) Products, and IV) New Behavior. These types are discussed against existing frameworks dealing with sustainability-oriented innovations (SOIs) emphasizing the particularities of the bioeconomy. Moreover, we derive implications for each type as commercialization challenges that are discussed with bioeconomy experts from natural sciences and economics to improve the external validity of the proposed typology. In total, this is the first approach to conceptualize innovation types in the bioeconomy, filling the structural void in bioeconomy research and innovation management. The here presented typology can be applied as a guiding principle for future research avenues, monitoring the evolution of the bioeconomy as well to design innovation strategies by researchers, policy makers and managers.},

Part A presents a SWOT analysis of a new dismantling based recycling process of plastic components and the integration in an existing post-shredder separation recycling facility. Subsequently, recycling strategies are developed and the economic potential is evaluated. Part B investigates the technical feasibility of the recycling strategies. As a case study the dismantling of LCD TV plastic back cover housings is taken. First, the advantages and disadvantages of the new process and the main external factors based on the market for recycled plastics and the waste material input are discussed on industrial level. Subsequently, five recycling strategies are developed: Strategy (1) produces recycled granulates with the dismantling process for direct re-application in electronic products, strategy (2) recycles plastics for the use as carrier materials for flame retardant masterbatches, strategy (3) blends the recycled plastic with post-shredder recyclates for material upgrading, strategy (4) recycles the plastics with the post-shredder process and strategy (5) thermally treats plastics. Finally, the economic evaluation shows that the special engineering plastics used for LCD TV back covers have very high virgin prices up to 5 € per kg. The implementation of the new process indicates a significant potential for value recovery based on plastics that would otherwise be incin-erated or downcycled.},

abstract = {Switching from the current linear model of economy to a circular one has recently attracted increased attention from major global companies e.g., Google, Unilever, Renault, and policymakers attending the World Economic Forum. The reasons for this are the huge financial, social and environmental benefits. However, the global shift from one model of economy to another also concerns smaller companies on a micro-level. Thus, comprehensive knowledge on designing circular business models is needed to stimulate and foster implementation of the circular economy. Existing business models for the circular economy have limited transferability and there is no comprehensive framework supporting every kind of company in designing a circular business model. This study employs a literature review to identify and classify the circular economy characteristics according to a business model structure. The investigation in the eight sub-domains of research on circular business models was used to redefine the components of the business model canvas in the context of the circular economy. Two new components—the take-back system and adoption factors—have been identified, thereby leading to the conceptualization of an extended framework for the circular business model canvas. Additionally, the triple fit challenge has been recognized as an enabler of the transition towards a circular business model. Some directions for further research have been outlined, as well.},

abstract = {Two different strategies aiming at increasing household source-separation of food waste were assessed through a case-study in a Swedish residential area (a) use of written information, distributed as leaflets amongst households and (b) installation of equipment for source-segregation of waste with the aim of increasing convenience food waste sorting in kitchens. Weightings of separately collected food waste before and after distribution of written information suggest that this resulted in neither a significant increased amount of separately collected food waste, nor an increased source-separation ratio. After installation of sorting equipment in households, both the amount of separately collected food waste as well as the source-separation ratio increased vastly. Long-term monitoring shows that results where longstanding. Results emphasize the importance of convenience and existence of infrastructure necessary for source-segregation of waste as important factors for household waste recycling, but also highlight the need of addressing these aspects where waste is generated, i.e. already inside the household. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Increasing pressure from governments and stakeholders has motivated the study of sustainability assessment in the supply chain context at operational, tactical, and strategic levels. Several papers have been published during the last two decades, and the number is still rising. Although several authors present complex models that include environmental and social assessment, the applicability and usefulness of these works is often limited by lack of data availability and lack of consensus in what is to be measured on implementations of sustainable practices and strategies. This paper presents a systematic literature review of works addressing the supply chain network design (SCND) problem, in which at least two of the three dimensions of sustainability are assessed. This paper aims to identify indicators that are used when sustainability is evaluated in real applied cases. A total of 113 papers from 2015 to 2018 were selected, including documents studying forward, reverse, and closed loop supply chains (CLSC). Indicators in the economic, environmental, and social dimensions were classified according to an existing framework in the sustainable supply chain literature. The review finds a highlighted emphasis on environmental considerations; social criteria are still hardly studied. The study country origin analysis also shows an increasing concern for sustainable practices in developing economies, mainly in Asia. Finally, this paper presents a brief description of the areas where research opportunities exist, including sectors, measures, and methodologies to assess sustainability in the SCND problem.},

Fibre reinforcement may improve green mechanical properties of printed samples, which was investigated in this study using a range of different short fibres added to a matrix of cellulose-modified gypsum powder. Mechanical testing of printed samples revealed a bending strength increase of 180{\%} and up to 10 times higher work of fracture values compared to non-reinforced printed samples.},

abstract = {In bone drilling process during the surgical operations, heating increases due to high bone/drill contact friction that damages the bones and soft tissues. The overheating is usually recognized as the temperature rise exceeds 47 °C, a critical limit, above which the drilling causes osteonecrosis. In this study, a new driller system is developed to prevent the overheating in orthopedic surgeries. It has a closed-circuit cooling system to reduce the undesired temperature rise during the drilling process. It is also designed and manufactured as a prototype and tested experimentally in vitro by drilling fresh bovine bones using different processing parameters. In the drilling tests, the temperature levels of the bones are measured using thermocouple sensors. Based on the measured results, the driller system provides a valuable temperature reduction around 25 {\%} to prevent necrosis in low spindle speeds (rpm) usually preferred by surgeons. The measured temperatures from the tests of the driller system with a cooling system were compared with the use of regular bone drilling process without cooling. The optimum processing parameters of the new driller system with/without coolant are calculated using the Taguchi method, and the most effective parameter is found as rpm. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract = {The use of thermoplastic composites reinforced with long or continuous fibers underwent an amazing increase due to advantages such as good mechanical performance, high temperature resistance, recyclable and chemical stability when compared with simple thermosetting matrices. These advantages allowed for the replacement of thermosetting systems by composites that led to the discovery of new applications. However, the processing procedure of thermoplastics reinforced with prepregs yarns entails some technological and scientific challenges mainly due to its high viscosity that results in difficulty and complexity in impregnating the reinforcements. Concerning engineering components market requirements, the polyamide thermoplastic matrices reinforced with carbon fibers have a huge demand due to the versatility of the applications where they can be used. This work presents, therefore, the development of a low-cost device that combines the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing technique together with the processing and consolidation of thermoplastic prepregs yarns for manufacturing parts made of polyamide reinforced with carbon fibers without need of post-processing operations. To evaluate the mechanical properties of the polyamide reinforced with carbon fibers, samples were manufactured and three point bending and tensile tests were done. From results it was demonstrated the very high structural strength to both bending and tensile loads of tested material.},

This paper documents two episodes of collective invention and proposes a general model based on search theory. The first episode deals with the development of mass production steel in the U.S. (1866-1885), and the second with early personal computers (1975-1985).  In both cases technical people openly discussed and sometimes shared technology they were developing.  Both technologies advanced to the point that they supported substantial economic growth.  Open source software development is partway through a similar process now. The episodes have common features.  The process begins with an invention or a change in legal restrictions.  Hobbyists and startup firms experiment with practical methods of production and share their results through a social network.  The members of the network form a new industry or change an existing one.  The network then disappears if the new firms keep their research and development secret.  A model of the search for innovations can describe this process if it is expanded to include independent hobbyists and consultants as well as profit-seeking firms.},

The powder reuse or recycling times directly affect the affordability of the additively manufactured parts, especially for the AM of titanium parts. This study examines the influence of powder reuse times on the characteristics of Ti-6Al-4V powder, including powder composition, particle size distribution (PSD), apparent density, tap density, flowability, and particle morphology. In addition, tensile samples were manufactured and evaluated with respect to powder reuse times and sample locations in the powder bed. The following findings were made from reusing the same batch of powder 21 times for AM by selective electron beam melting: (i) the oxygen (O) content increased progressively with increasing reuse times but both the Al content and the V content remained generally stable (a small decrease only); (ii) the powder became less spherical with increasing reuse times and some particles showed noticeable distortion and rough surfaces after being reused 16 times; (iii) the PSD became narrower and few satellite particles were observed after 11 times of reuse; (iv) reused powder showed improved flowability; and (v) reused powder showed no measurable undesired influence on the AM process and the samples exhibited highly consistent tensile properties, irrespective of their locations in the powder bed. The implications of these findings were discussed.},

Thus, this article aims to identify and map the application of LCSA in the main scientific databases, through a process of bibliometric and systematic literature review. Therefore, a bibliographic portfolio that represents the publications of the LCSA was selected based on selection criteria, after which the bibliometric and systematic analyses were performed. The bibliometric analysis identified the temporal distribution of publications, journals, authors, and countries that contribute to the context, as well as a studies' keyword analysis. The systematic analysis was carried out by verifying the types of studies present in the bibliographic portfolio, the economic sectors and countries of applied studies localization, the indicators and methodologies used to evaluate each sustainability dimension, and the main methodologies for results final analyses were also verified. The selected bibliographic portfolio consisted of 105 publications, corresponding to the period 2008–2019. The results show that developed countries have a greater number of publications. However, China stands out with the highest number of publications. Most of the studies in the portfolio are developments of methodologies and applications in case studies. The applied studies covered several economic and global localization sectors. Moreover, it was found that there is a great variability of environmental, economic, and social indicators employed, as well as methodologies for analyzing the final results. For example, the main indicators were: eutrophication and acidification; electricity and operating and maintenance costs, and employment; and multi-criteria decision analysis (MDCA) was the most widely used methodology. This research makes several new contributions, providing academics and professionals with an overview of the application of LCSA, through scientific indexes and the main approaches of publications, as well as the perspectives of new research.},

abstract = {Growing consumption has brought a series of environmental problems. Sustainable consumption patterns which could meet human needs, improve the quality of lives, and reduce pollutants in the product life cycle emerge and develop. With the development and application of information and network technology, the scale and variety of data are increasing rapidly; advances in data analytics have made the economy, and consumption, quantifiable and visible. At present, many scholars rely on a big-data background and carry out research on sustainable consumption. Therefore, we called for sustainable and consumption papers for special volume of Journal of Cleaner Production (JCLPRO). We received submissions from all over the world and eventually accepted 45. This Special Issue forming a study on sustainable energy consumption, low-carbon transportation, waste recovery and recycling, climate change cost assessment, application and policy modelling for big data and sustainable consumption to promote sustainable development in the fields of energy consumption, low-carbon transportation, waste recovery, and so on. The authors have analysed the problems of pollution and carbon emission in different regions and product production cycles, according to the background of specific regions and enterprises, through data mining, measurement models, and an evaluation index system. Some suggestions are provided for urban construction and enterprise development according to the results.},

Designed to examine global environment and development to the year 2000 and beyond, the commission seeks to reassess critical problems, to formulate realistic proposals for solving them, and to raise the level of understanding and commitment to the issues of environment and development. Rather than presenting a gloom and doom report about the destruction of natural resources, Our Common Future offers an agenda advocating the growth of economies based on policies that do not harm, and can even enhance, the environment. The commission recognizes that the time has come for a marriage of economy and ecology, in order to ensure the growth of human progress through development without bankrupting the resources of future generations.},

abstract = {This review describes the consumer related material and socio-cultural drivers behind food waste found in academic and grey literature. The aim is to identify intervention points for design interventions to reduce household food waste. Within the reviewed literature, an array of different aspects of consumer food waste is studied such as consumer behaviour, attitudes, beliefs and values, quantifications and compositional analyses of food waste in Western countries, waste prevention and concrete design interventions. This illustrates that the problem of consumer food wasting practices is an issue that is complex and involves both socio-cultural and material factors. However, the literature is more focused on generating knowledge about the problem than on finding solutions. Thus, further research should attempt to find ways to test new ideas and interventions that could reduce food waste in households.},

abstract = {Currently, a significant transformation for energy systems has emerged as a result of the trend to develop an energy framework without fossil fuel reliance, the concerns about climate change and air quality, and the need to provide electricity to around of 17{\%} of world population who lacks the service. Accordingly, the deployment of power plants located close to end-users and including multiple energy sources and carriers, along with the growing share of renewable energies, have suggested changes in the energy sector. Despite their potential capabilities, the design of distributed energy systems (DES) is a complex problem due to the simultaneous goals and constraints that need to be considered, as well as to the high context dependence of this kind of projects. For these reasons, in this work a systematic literature review of DES including hydrogen as energy vector, was made analyzing 106 research papers published between the years 2000–2018, and extracted from Scopus {\textregistered} and Web of Science databases. The aim was to identify how hydrogen is employed (technologies, uses) and the criteria that are evaluated (economic, technical, social and environmental) when these systems are designed, planned and/or operated. The results constitute a baseline information covering the type of technologies, equipment sizes and hydrogen applications, that could be valuable for the preliminary stages of research or project planning of DES involving hydrogen. Furthermore, other factors have also been identified, such as the focus on techno-economic issues, and the lack of considering socio/political aspects and the uncertainty about input data like weather conditions, energy prices and demands. Additionally, a more integrated approach is needed including all the hydrogen supply chain stages and project stakeholders, to tackle issues like safety of the energy systems that could produce consumer rejections.},

Included is the standard delineation of AM technologies into seven broad categories. The economics of AM part generation is considered, and the impacts of the economics on application sectors are described. On the basis of current trends, the future outlook will include a convergence of AM fab-ricators, mass-produced AM fabricators, enabling of topology optimization designs, and specialization in the AM legal arena. Long-term developments with huge impact are organ printing and volume-based printing.},

abstract = {This study presents the findings from a study on the consumption of recycled materials and recycling practices in the plastics manufacturing industry and recycling companies in Malaysia. The findings were obtained from a survey conducted in twenty plastic manufacturing companies and detailed case studies in three recycling companies. The survey conducted in the plastic manufacturing companies' shows that the consumption rate for poly-olefins (PP and PE) is the highest among the resin types and the industrial sector that consumes the most plastic materials is the electrical and electronics sector. The consumption of recycled materials is high among the local manufacturing companies (80{\%}) which are largely due to cost savings; about 20{\%} of these companies conducted in-house recycling. The study has also shown that the medium scale industry consumes the most recycled materials as compared to the large and small scale industry. The rate of disposal for plastic materials in the local industry is approximately 5{\%}. The detailed case studies conducted in the recycling companies have successfully identified the main processes involved in plastic recycling namely manual sorting, cleaning, drying, meshing/pelletising and packaging. These recycling companies obtained recycled materials from various sources including industrial scrap, dumping sites, local producers as well as imported sources. Pricing of recycled materials were based on classification according to grade and quality of the recycled materials. The study has reflected the extent of in-house recycling trends in the local plastic manufacturing companies and their dependency on the supply from the local recycling companies. {\textcopyright} 2007 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract = {Healthcare is a major emitter of environmental pollutants that adversely affect health. Within the healthcare community, awareness of these effects is low, and recognition of the duty to address them is only beginning to gain traction. Healthcare sustainability science explores dimensions of resource consumption and environmental emissions associated with healthcare activities. This emerging field provides tools and metrics to quantify the unintended consequences of healthcare delivery and evaluate effective approaches that improve patient safety while protecting public health. This narrative review describes the scope of healthcare sustainability research, identifies knowledge gaps, introduces a framework for applications of existing research methods and tools to the healthcare context, and establishes research priorities to improve the environmental performance of healthcare services. The framework was developed through review of the current state of healthcare sustainability science and expert consensus by the Working Group for Environmental Sustainability in Clinical Care. Key recommendations include: development of a comprehensive life cycle inventory database for medical devices and drugs; application of standardized sustainability performance metrics at the clinician, hospital/health system, and national levels; revision of infection control standards driving non-evidence-based uptake of single-use disposable devices; call for increased federal research funding; and formation of a Global Commission on the Advancement of Environmental Sustainability in Healthcare. There is an urgent need for research that informs policy and practice to address the public health crisis arising from healthcare pollution. A transformational vision is required to align research priorities to achieve a sustainable healthcare system that advances quality, safety and value.},

abstract = {The circular economy concept is much discussed in the European Union (EU), but only limited progress has been accomplished so far regarding its implementation. Most scholarly studies blame this on various technological barriers. Our work rebuts these studies. We present the first large-N-study on circular economy barriers in the EU (208 survey respondents, 47 expert interviews). We find that cultural barriers, particularly a lack of consumer interest and awareness as well as a hesitant company culture, are considered the main circular economy barriers by businesses and policy-makers. These are driven by market barriers which, in turn, are induced by a lack of synergistic governmental interventions to accelerate the transition towards a circular economy. Meanwhile, not a single technological barrier is ranked among the most pressing circular economy barriers, according to our research. Overall, our work suggests that circular economy is a niche discussion among sustainable development professionals at this stage. Significant efforts need to be undertaken for the concept to maintain its momentum.},

abstract = {This study merges insights from two well-known attitude-behavior theories-the theory of planned behavior and the model of altruistic behavior-with elements from two broader models from environmental psychology-the model of environmental behavior and the model of environmental concern-to propose a comprehensive structural equation model to explain recycling behavior. The specified model is estimated using data from the most recent national survey performed in Portugal on the subject. In general, results support the use of the theory of planned behavior as a basis for modeling recycling participation. However, the integration of this theory with the Schwartz's model is only partially achieved. Another important finding is that recycling behavior is indirectly determined by personal psychological features, such as social conscience, but not by general ecological attitudes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {This study explores the value of visualizing the prototyping activities in a new product development process from idea to production. Through a case study of a hardware startup, we present a retrospective and longitudinal study of their prototyping processes, from early idea to the introduction of several product generations to market. We call the visualization technique ProtoMapping, and we use the qualitative and quantitative data captured by the ProtoMap to understand how prototyping strategies change over the course of product development processes. Specifically, we focus on the prototyping of parallel concepts, iterations of concepts, manufacturing processes used for prototypes, prototype media, prototype tests, as well as prototyping of isolated or integrated systems. On the basis of this longitudinal analysis, we present a number of insights that were possible to uncover with ProtoMapping. We observe how parallel prototypes of isolated systems can be used to explore the solution space and later be synthesized into prototypes for integrated systems. Furthermore, we understand how the need to scale up production can lead to increased prototyping activities, as several parts of a product must be redesigned. This study illustrates the utility of a retrospective visualization approach and serves as the first step in formulation of generalized guidelines for prototyping strategies in holistic product development.},

abstract = {This paper presents an empirical study focusing on the role of mock-ups to support user/citizens co-creation and the anticipation of the User eXperience within a specific urban Living Lab. Scholars have previously identified different principles characterizing a Living Lab, such as: “realism”, spontaneity, continuity and empowerment, which represent the “live” dimension of Living Labs. However, these principles are quite difficult to practically implement. Nonetheless, we conducted an experiment in the context of an urban project dedicated to the design of mobility stations that reveals the paramount importance of the mock-up role for implementing the “realism” principle. The findings unveil the great potential of close-to-real-life immersion of users/citizens in realistic environments to not only fulfilling the “realism” principle but also greatly contributing to the adoption by users/citizens. Finally, this study gives some elements to support citizens' engagement in the co-creation stage of the urban design process towards the realization of smart-cities.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews are characterized by a methodical and replicable methodology and presentation. They involve a comprehensive search to locate all relevant published and unpublished work on a subject; a systematic integration of search results; and a critique of the extent, nature, and quality of evidence in relation to a particular research question. The best reviews synthesize studies to draw broad theoretical conclusions about what a literature means, linking theory to evidence and evidence to theory. This guide describes how to plan, conduct, organize, and present a systematic review of quantitative (meta-analysis) or qualitative (narrative review, meta-synthesis) information. We outline core standards and principles and describe commonly encountered problems. Although this guide targets psychological scientists, its high level of abstraction makes it potentially relevant to any subject area or discipline. We argue that systematic reviews are a key methodology for clarifying whether and how research findings replicate and for explaining possible inconsistencies, and we call for researchers to conduct systematic reviews to help elucidate whether there is a replication crisis.},

abstract = {Traditional assembly line manufacturing is speculative, costly and environmentally unsustainable. It is speculative because it commits substantial resources - energy, materials, shipping, handling, stocking and displaying - without a guaranteed sale. It is costly because each of these resources - material, process, people and place - involves expense not encountered when a product is manufactured at the time of sale. It is environmentally unsustainable because, no matter how much recycling is done, not using the resources unless actually needed is always a better path. Three-dimensional printing is currently of great commercial interest as it can be employed to manufacture parts on-demand economically and without the significant cost {\&} environmental downsides, i.e. inventory and waste, associated with traditional manufacturing processes. Herein, we describe the formulation of a novel water-based material which can be used in a traditional 3D printer extrusion process to create optically transparent glass-based objects. Such objects have a wide range of applications including, but not wholly limited to: security printing using color {\&} coating effects, protective films and coatings, electronic codes readable by smartphones, tablets or touch screens. Additional all glass objects traditionally manufactured by the so called kiln glass method can be generated by this type of 3D printing making it interesting for the high end market of art objects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Materials Research Society.},

Its advantages over conventional manufacturing have captivat- ed the imagination of the public, reflected in recent main- stream publications that call additive manufacturing “the third industrial revolution.” This paper reviews the societal impact of additive manufacturing from a technical perspec- tive. Abundance of evidences were found to support the promises of additive manufacturing in the following areas: (1) customized healthcare products to improve population health and quality of life, (2) reduced environmental impact for manufacturing sustainability, and (3) simplified supply chain to increase efficiency and responsiveness in demand fulfillment.

This work is addressed to understand the eight effects, especially effects related to research {\&} development (R{\&}D) on the decoupling economic growth from carbon emission through a decomposition technique and a decoupling effort model. The results of sector analysis show that the changes of carbon emission in industry sector and transportation sector were dominant contributor and inhibitor to the drop of carbon emission, respectively. The decomposition results indicate that energy intensity was the leading contributor to the drop of carbon emission, followed by R{\&}D intensity, sectoral carbon intensity, R{\&}D efficiency; whereas economic scale was the primary inhibitor to the drop of carbon emission, followed by investment intensity, population size and sectoral energy structure. The results of decoupling efforts analysis uncover that energy intensity, R{\&}D intensity, R{\&}D efficiency and sectoral carbon intensity contributed to decoupling economic growth from carbon emission, whereas investment intensity, population size and sectoral energy structure did not contribute to the decoupling.

abstract = {Background: Over the last years the variety of food and beverage packaging has increased with the development of new plastic materials and (co)polymer modifications. Oligomers which are always present in polymers evoke attention as potential migrants, from a qualitatively and quantitatively viewpoint. Scope and approach: This article deals with oligomers as potential migrants from plastics food contact materials and reviews their occurrence as well as analytical methods for their identification and quantification. Additionally a section about migration summarizes literature providing oligomer levels in food simulants and foods. Special attention was given to polycondensates since these represent a rapidly expanding polymer field due to increased numbers of (co)-monomers authorized by the EU. Key findings and conclusions: Evaluating a polymer regarding the content and migration potential of its oligomers several factors like the separation of oligomers from the material, the choice of suitable separation and detection techniques for identification and quantification and the choice of an appropriate standard have to be considered. Generally, MS technologies coupled to liquid chromatography have been shown to represent the analytical approach of choice. This is, so far as the authors are aware of, the first review exclusively focusing on analytical methods for oligomers as polymer specific substances, which suggests to consider them as a separate polymer related and polymer type specific group besides the so-called non-intentionally added substances (NIAS).},

Technological development capability, which is required to acquire, select, or utilize source technology for company competitiveness, becomes the competitive edge and key capability to gain distinctiveness. Accordingly, the objective of this research was to investigate the influential factors on performance by suggesting technological development results and technology commercialization as the outcome of technological development capability and to identify the capability required for successful technological development performance and technology commercialization for companies through previous academic research. Moreover, the study aimed to investigate performance differences according to technology business groups by dividing the groups into high-technology companies, medium-technology companies, and low-technology companies. As a result of the analysis, among the indicators constituting technological development capability, manpower in technological development and technological development-specialized research centers had a positive influence on the product competitiveness of technological development performance. Also, technological development expenses and technology skill levels were verified to have positive impacts on the technology competitiveness of technological development performance. As for technology commercialization performance, the more manpower that is in research and development, the higher the sales amounts by technological development; also, the higher the technology skill levels, the higher the export amounts by technological development. Moreover, technology business groups had differences in performance. This research has significance in focusing on the influence of the technological development capability of companies on technological development performance and technology commercialization performance. Future research is expected to draw new variations different from the analysis results from existing studies by setting variations, investigating complementary relationships among variations in detail, and utilizing statistical techniques that can control mutual relationships among variations.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, Collective Intelligence (CI) platforms have become a vital resource for learning, problem solving, decision-making, and predictions. This rising interest in the topic has to led to the development of several models and frameworks available in published literature. Unfortunately, most of these models are built around domain-specific requirements, i.e., they are often based on the intuitions of their domain experts and developers. This has created a gap in our knowledge in the theoretical foundations of CI systems and models, in general. In this article, we attempt to fill this gap by conducting a systematic review of CI models and frameworks, identified from a collection of 9,418 scholarly articles published since 2000. Eventually, we contribute by aggregating the available knowledge from 12 CI models into one novel framework and present a generic model that describes CI systems irrespective of their domains. We add to the previously available CI models by providing a more granular view of how different components of CI systems interact. We evaluate the proposed model by examining it with respect to six popular, ongoing CI initiatives available on the Web.},

abstract = {The production and consumption of plastics, although inevitable in our modern life, are predominantly unsustainable and inefficient. Hence, the concept of a circular economy for plastics has been proposed as a sustainable approach to thrive both economy and our modern life. To implement a circular economy for plastics, an understanding of both individuals' and organizations' behaviors is needed since psychological effects often undermine technical solutions. We particularly focus on organizations' behaviors since commercial plastic waste has not been thoroughly investigated compared to household plastic waste. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), we assess the determinants of intentions and behaviors of 637 organizations in Belgium towards a circular economy for plastics. Our PLS-SEM analysis support that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control of decision makers positively influence organizations' intentions to implement best practices of plastic recycling. Furthermore, organizations' intentions, perceived behavioral control, pressures, and enablers positively, whereas barriers negatively, influence organizations' behaviors. Our study shows that most organizations have positive intentions, yet they seem to be failing in implementing best practices of plastic recycling due to some critical barriers. To overcome this intention-behavior gap and to attain a circular economy for plastics, our study suggests some measures.},

The multifaceted concept of "ecosystem services" includes a normative component, which has strong implicit links to the notion of sustainability. Yet, how ecosystem services research relates to sustainability has received little attention. We reviewed the current state of research on ecosystem services, and examined whether the concept's original motivation has allowed it to act as an effective boundary object for the integration of the diverse knowledge related to sustainability. A full-text, multivariate statistical analysis of 1388 peer-reviewed publications on ecosystem services from 1997 to 2011 revealed a rapidly growing but fragmented body of research, which has emphasized the development of descriptive understandings of human-nature interactions. Future challenges for the ecosystem services concept include greater integration of currently fragmented knowledge domains and stronger engagement with the concept's normative foundations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The quality of recycled resins of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) separated from mixed solid waste (MSW) were studied by analyzing the tentative low molecular weight contaminants. For that purpose a microwave assisted extraction (MAE) technique was developed using MDPE and two aromatic antioxidants (Irganox 1010 and Irgafos 168) as models. A 50:50 mixture of cyclohexane and isopropanol gave high recovery yields; 97{\%} for Irgafos 168 and 93{\%} for Irganox 1010 and short extraction times. Limonene, isopropylester of myristic and palmitic acids were examples of products identified in recycled HDPE. These compounds are typically fragrance and flavor constituents. In addition alcohols, esters, ketones were identified. Most of the substances are constituents of the packaging fillings at their first usage. But the possibility that contaminants may have entered the material by contact with other plastics is not excluded. The major category of compounds identified already in the virgin material is composed of aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g. pentadecane, hexadecaned, 1-hexadenene), branched alkanes, branched alkenes and others. The same kind of compounds were also identified in the recycled materials at a similar concentration as in virgin ones. Virgin and recycled polyethylene contain also ethylbenzene and o-, m- and p-xylenes, where o-xylene had the largest peak of the four. The aromatic hydrocarbons are probably parts of additives, which degraded during extraction and sample preparation procedures. Aromatic hydrocarbons without functional groups, such as ethylbenzene and xylenes are considered highly toxic, but the height and area of their peaks suggest low concentrations. The concentration of these hazardous contaminants in the recycled resin is, however, approximately five times higher in recycled material, estimated by a comparison of the peak areas. Ethylbenzene and o-, m- and p-xylenes, o-xylene having the largest peak of the four were also identified in virgin and recycled polypropylene resins.},

abstract = {In the last few years Circular Economy (CE) is receiving increasing attention worldwide as a way to overcome the current production and consumption model based on continuous growth and increasing resource throughput. By promoting the adoption of closing-the-loop production patterns within an economic system CE aims to increase the efficiency of resource use, with special focus on urban and industrial waste, to achieve a better balance and harmony between economy, environment and society. This study provides an extensive review of the literature of last two decades, with the purpose of grasping the main CE features and perspectives: origins, basic principles, advantages and disadvantages, modelling and implementation of CE at the different levels (micro, meso and macro) worldwide. Results evidence that CE origins are mainly rooted in ecological and environmental economics and industrial ecology. In China CE is promoted as a top-down national political objective while in other areas and countries as European Union, Japan and USA it is a tool to design bottom-up environmental and waste management policies. The ultimate goal of promoting CE is the decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth. The implementation of CE worldwide still seems in the early stages, mainly focused on recycle rather than reuse. Important results have been achieved in some activity sectors (e.g. in waste management, where large waste recycling rates are achieved in selected developed countries). CE implies the adoption of cleaner production patterns at company level, an increase of producers and consumers responsibility and awareness, the use of renewable technologies and materials (wherever possible) as well as the adoption of suitable, clear and stable policies and tools. The lesson learned from successful experiences is that the transition towards CE comes from the involvement of all actors of the society and their capacity to link and create suitable collaboration and exchange patterns. Success stories also point out the need for an economic return on investment, in order to provide suitable motivation to companies and investors. In summary, the CE transition has just started. Moreover, the interdisciplinary framework underpinning CE offers good prospects for gradual improvement of the present production and consumption models, no longer adequate because of their environmental load and social inequity, a clear indicator of resource use inefficiency.},

To determine if 3D printing could affect these markets if consumers offset purchases by 3D printing free designs, this study investigates the 100 most popular downloaded designs at MyMiniFactory in a month. Savings are quantified for using a Lulzbot Mini 3D printer and three filament types: commercial filament, pellet-extruded filament, and post-consumer waste converted to filament with a recyclebot. Case studies probed the quality of: (1) six common complex toys; (2) Lego blocks; and (3) the customizability of open source board games. All filaments analyzed saved the user over 75{\%} of the cost of commercially available true alternative toys and over 90{\%} for recyclebot filament. Overall, these results indicate a single 3D printing repository among dozens is saving consumers well over {\$}60 million/year in offset purchases. The most common savings fell by 40{\%}–90{\%} in total savings, which came with the ability to make novel toys and games. The results of this study show consumers can generate higher value items for less money using the open source distributed manufacturing paradigm. It appears clear that consumer do-it-yourself (DIY) manufacturing is set to have a significant impact on the toy and game markets in the future.},

@article{Song1972,
abstract = {In 1972, three scientists from MIT created a computer model that analyzed global resource consumption and production. Their results shocked the world and created stirring conversation about global 'overshoot,' or resource use beyond the carrying capacity of the planet. Now, preeminent environmental scientists Donnella Meadows, Jorgen Randers, and Dennis Meadows have teamed up again to update and expand their original findings in The Limits to Growth: The 30 Year Update. Meadows, Randers, and Meadows are international environmental leaders recognized for their groundbreaking research into early signs of wear on the planet. Citing climate change as the most tangible example of our current overshoot, the scientists now provide us with an updated scenario and a plan to reduce our needs to meet the carrying capacity of the planet. Over the past three decades, population growth and global warming have forged on with a striking semblance to the scenarios laid out by the World3 computer model in the original Limits to Growth. While Meadows, Randers, and Meadows do not make a practice of predicting future environmental degradation, they offer an analysis of present and future trends in resource use, and assess a variety of possible outcomes. In many ways, the message contained in Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update is a warning. Overshoot cannot be sustained without collapse. But, as the authors are careful to point out, there is reason to believe that humanity can still reverse some of its damage to Earth if it takes appropriate measures to reduce inefficiency and waste. Written in refreshingly accessible prose, Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update is a long anticipated revival of some of the original voices in the growing chorus of sustainability. Limits to Growth: The 30 Year Update is a work of stunning intelligence that will expose for humanity the hazy but critical line between human growth and human development.},

abstract = {Despite almost a decade of living lab activity all over Europe, there still is a lack of empirical research into the practical implementation and the related outcomes of living labs. Therefore, this article proposes a framework to create a better understanding of the characteristics and outcomes of living labs. We investigate three living labs in Belgium and one in Finland to learn how the different building blocks of living lab environments contribute to the outputs of innovation projects launched within the lab. The findings imply that managers and researchers contemplating innovation in living labs need to consider the intended inputs and outcomes, and reframe their innovation activities accordingly. We formulate practical guidelines on how living labs should be managed on the levels of community interaction, stakeholder engagement, and methodological setup to succeed in implementing living lab projects and to create user-centred innovations. That way, living lab practitioners can work towards a more sustainable way of setting up living labs that can run innovation projects over a longer period of time.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to ascertain the stab resistance characteristics of a series of planar and articulated laser sintered (LS) samples, in accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) Body Armour Standard - Publication 39/07. Design/methodology/approach - A series of LS planar samples were manufactured using an EOS P100 Formiga system, manufactured from 100 per cent virgin or a 50:50 mix of recycled and virgin Nylon (PA2200), ranging in thickness from 1-10 mm. All planar samples were stab tested to the HOSDB knife-resistance (KR) level one impact energy of 24 Joules, using an in-house manufactured HOSDB guided rail drop test impact rig and standardised knives. Penetration through the underside of each sample was measured and recorded. These results were then used to develop an articulated, additive manufactured (AM) scale textile - LS from a 50:50 mix of recycled and virgin PA2200 powder. These samples were then tested using the aforementioned impact rig and stab impact energy. Findings - The research demonstrated that while virgin PA2200 sample required a minimum thickness of 8mm to achieve stab-resistance below the HOSDB maximum penetration limit of 7 mm, this figure can be reduced to 5.6mm when manufacturing LS planar samples from a 50:50 mix of virgin and recycled PA2200. Results from stab testing the articulated samples indicated a successful AM textile-like design, with a maximum knife penetration of 1.6mm - below the 7mm HOSDB limit. Originality/value - The paper describes a unique application of AM technologies for the manufacture of high-performance stab resistant AM textiles. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

We evaluated trends in research outputs in the period 1990–2010, during which the provision of recycling facilities to householders has greatly expanded and requirements have become more extensive and often more complex. Variables affecting the recycling behaviour of householders were classified into four theoretical groups: socio-psychological, technical-organisational, individual socio-demographic and study-specific. These groups (clusters) were identified in a meta-analysis of 63 empirical studies culled from published research. The strongest predictors of householders' recycling behaviour were identified as being convenience, moral norms, information and environmental concern. The theoretical framework developed can be used to formulate questionnaires and in data analysis.},

abstract = {The release of the open source 3-D printer known as the RepRap (a self-Replicating Rapid prototyper) resulted in the potential for distributed manufacturing of products for significantly lower costs than conventional manufacturing. This development, coupled with open source-appropriate technology (OSAT), has enabled the opportunity for 3-D printers to be used for sustainable development. In this context, OSAT provides the opportunity to modify and improve the physical designs of their printers and desired digitally-shared objects. However, these 3-D printers require electricity while more than a billion people still lack electricity. To enable the utilization of RepRaps in off-grid communities, solar photovoltaic (PV)-powered mobile systems have been developed, but recent improvements in novel delta-style 3-D printer designs allows for reduced costs and improved performance. This study builds on these innovations to develop and experimentally validate a mobile solar-PV-powered delta 3-D printer system. It is designed to run the RepRap 3-D printer regardless of solar flux. The electrical system design is tested outdoors for operating conditions: (1) PV charging battery and running 3-D printer; (2) printing under low insolation; (3) battery powering the 3-D printer alone; (4) PV charging the battery only; and (5) battery fully charged with PV-powered 3-D printing. The results show the system performed as required under all conditions providing feasibility for adoption in off-grid rural communities. 3-D printers powered by affordable mobile PV solar systems have a great potential to reduce poverty through employment creation, as well as ensuring a constant supply of scarce products for isolated communities.},

abstract = {After a discussion of the quantity and quality of plastic wastes of various origin, the different possibilities for recycling these wastes are critically reviewed. Closed-loop recycling of pure, well-defined wastes is a problem only in critical applications. The recycling of mixed wastes, on the other hand, gives rise to a number of technical and economic difficulties. Direct processing is difficult, because of the different melting behaviour and thermal stability of the various components, and moreover leads to polymer "alloys" with poor mechanical properties and marketing potential. Sorting processes still yield fractions of insufficient purity. Compatibilising additives are expensive and not very efficient. The future of recycling depends on the development of new markets for plastics with inferior properties and of processing methods to improve the properties of mixed plastics. Pyrolysis and hydrolysis open a range of interesting developments, but their economic and technical feasibility remain to be proven. Incineration, biodegradation and tipping cannot be considered to be fully satisfactory disposal methods, and recycling should be encouraged wherever it is economically and technically feasible. ?? 1977.},

abstract = {Packaging is expected to become the leading application for nano-composites by 2020 due to the great advantages on mechanical and active properties achieved with these substances. As novel materials, and although there are some current applications in the market, there is still unknown areas under development. One key issue to be addressed is to know more about the implications of the nano-composite packaging materials once they become waste. The present study evaluates the extrusion process of four nanomaterials (Layered silicate modified nanoclay (Nanoclay1), Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3), Silver (Ag) and Zinc Oxide (ZnO) as part of different virgin polymer matrices of polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP) and Polyethyleneterephtalate (PET). Thus, the following film plastic materials: (PE-Nanoclay1, PE-CaCO3, PP-Ag, PET-ZnO, PET-Ag, PET-Nanoclay1) have been processed considering different recycling scenarios. Results on recyclability show that for PE and PP, in general terms and except for some minor variations in yellowness index, tensile modulus, tensile strength and tear strength (PE with Nanoclay1, PP with Ag), the introduction of nanomaterial in the recycling streams for plastic films does not affect the final recycled plastic material in terms of mechanical properties and material quality compared to conventional recycled plastic. Regarding PET, results show that the increasing addition of nanomaterial into the recycled PET matrix (especially PET-Ag) could influence important properties of the recycled material, due to a slight degradation of the polymer, such as increasing pinholes, degradation fumes and elongation at break. Moreover, it should be noted that colour deviations were visible in most of the samples (PE, PP and PET) in levels higher than 0.3 units (limit perceivable by the human eye). The acceptance of these changes in the properties of recycled PE, PP and PET will depend on the specific applications considered (e.g. packaging applications are more strict in material quality that urban furniture or construction products).},

abstract = {Waste management is one of the primary problem that the world faces irrespective of the case of developed or developing country. The key issue in the waste management is that the garbage bin at public places gets overflowed well in advance before the commencement of the next cleaning process. It in turn leads to various hazards such as bad odor and ugliness to that place which may be the root cause for spread of various diseases. The increase in population, has led to tremendous degradation in the state of affairs of hygiene with respect to waste management system. The spillover of waste in civic areas generates the polluted condition in the neighboring areas. For eliminating or mitigating the garbage's and maintains the cleanness, it requires smartness based waste management system. The need of proper waste management does not end with just collection and proper dispose of garbage. It continues to the level of landfills and the amount that we can possibly recycle. Recycling is estimated to be highly useful given that our dependency on raw products reduces, besides the reduction of waste and subsequent landfills. Once the recycling is done to sort metals, plastics, and glass articles, the use of biodegradable waste can be extended beyond fertilizers and manure. The metals can be reused and the plastics can be diverted from the landfills, which otherwise leads to choking of the earth. The glass materials can be broken and melted back to form new articles after deep cleaning. This chapter aims to understand the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the most potential areas and the ultimate need to completely replace the human interaction.},

However, information about innovation activities in the bioeconomy and its outcomes is scattered and more systematic measurement efforts are useful for policy making to assess its impact and whether objectives are met. This article provides an overview of information needs and data availability for innovation indicators. Furthermore, data for key input and throughput indicators are presented and discussed for the bioeconomy in Germany. The data indicates a rather strong role of Germany for publications and patents. However, the commercial success remains unclear, because of current limitations in information availability about the output and outcome of innovations efforts. Here, the most critical information gap in exist. In order to improve this situation additional data collection such as innovation survey for the bioeconomy would be needed.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing processes are employed to create physical models from three-dimensional (3D) computer-Aided design (CAD) math data. A solid model or water-Tight surface model is used as the input, which is sliced into layers, and travel paths are created for each layer. The object is built by layer by layer stacking, with supporting structures for overhanging geometry and undercuts being created where necessary (process dependent). Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is an additive fabrication process that builds a part from extruded filaments of a melted thermoplastic. Several studies have focused on the depositing parameters; however, none of them have characterized internal support structures in different geometrical arrangements. The incorporation of reconfigurable parametric internal matrix structures based on primitive elements will balance the mechanical properties, the material usage and the build time. Parametric internal structures are designed, and compressive test components built and tested both experimentally and using simulation tools to depict the compressive characteristics. Extensive physical testing is done as the components built by the FDM process have anisotropic properties. The material usage, build time, and loading characteristics are captured for a variety of parametric structures (solid, shell, orthogonal, hexagonal, pyramid) build orientations, and internal densities (loose, compact). From this data, a model is developed that serves as a predictive tool to: (i) estimate the mechanical properties and (ii) calculate the build time and materials utilized based on various internal structural configurations for he component's application. A model that generates an optimal solution (minimum material, minimum build time, etc.) needs to be developed. Using the collected data as a foundation, an optimization model that considers the build time, material usage, surface finish, interior geometry, strength characteristics, and related parameters is presented and can be used to assist designers making informed decision with respect to strength, material usage and time, etc. is developed using the Genetic Algorithm approach. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of sci- entific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science.},

abstract = {There are two major ways in which solid waste can be sorted and recycled - at the household level, when households are required to sort waste into a given number of categories, or in specialised sorting facilities. Traditionally, it has been thought that sorting at the household level is an inconvenience, as it uses space and requires time and effort. Our study provides empirical evidence to the contrary, indicating that home sorting is a net source of utility for some people. Through a carefully designed choice experiment we collected stated choices from members of a Polish municipality with respect to the way their waste is sorted and how often it is collected. In the hypothetical scenario employed, respondents were informed that waste will be sorted anyway - if not at the household level then at a specialised sorting facility. Interestingly, analysis shows that a large group of people are willing to sort waste at the household level even if unsorted waste would be collected at no extra cost. For a minority, increased home sorting of waste would, however, impose a loss of utility. Overall, our results indicate that most respondents preferred to sort waste themselves if given the choice. We provide a few possible explanations of this perhaps surprising result, including the desire to promote a green external image, and a concern about the effectiveness of separation activities performed by others. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The recent development of the RepRap, an open source self-replicating rapid prototyper, has made low-cost 3-D printers readily available to the public at reasonable prices ({\textless}{\$}1,000). The RepRap (Prusa Mendell variant) currently prints 3-D objects in a 200x200x140 square millimeters build envelope from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). ABS and PLA are both thermoplastics that can be injection-molded, each with their own benefits, as ABS is rigid and durable, while PLA is plant-based and can be recycled and composted. The melting temperature of ABS and PLA enable use in low-cost 3-D printers, as these temperature are low enough to use in melt extrusion in the home, while high enough for prints to retain their shape at average use temperatures. Using 3-D printers to manufacture provides the ability to both change the fill composition by printing voids and fabricate shapes that are impossible to make using tradition methods like injection molding. This allows more complicated shapes to be created while using less material, which could reduce environmental impact.},

Using a regression analysis technique, the main findings are as follows. (i) There is a variation among users' choice of AM application, and the majority of users are expanding their AM applications beyond RP. (ii) There are two factors that positively affect the decision of firms to expand classical RP and also incorporate production and management. These two factors are using multiple AM technologies (as opposed to single Fused Deposition Modeling technology) and being small companies. The authors discuss the implication of these results.},

abstract = {Household waste separation at the source is a central part of waste management systems in Sweden. Resource recovery of materials and energy increased substantially after separate collection was implemented in the 1990s. A procedure to transform recycling behavior for the sorting of household waste—called the recycling behavior transition (RBT) procedure—was designed and implemented in a waste management system in Sweden. Repeated use of this procedure, which will assist in the continual improvement of household sorting, consists of the following four consecutive steps: (i) evaluating the current sorting behavior; (ii) identifying appropriate interventions; (iii) implementing the interventions, and; (iv) assessing the quantitative effect of the interventions. This procedure follows action research methodology and it is the first time that such a procedure has been developed and implemented for the sorting of household waste. The procedure can easily be adapted to any source separation system (which may have different local situations) and, by improving the source separation, will increase the resource recovery in the waste management system. The RBT procedure, together with its strengths and weaknesses, is discussed in this paper, and its implementation is exemplified by a pilot study done in Sweden.},

abstract = {Carbon performs have been fabricated using the three-dimensional printing (3DP) process for reaction-infiltrated SiC-Si composites. Starting with glassy carbon powders of 45-105 $\mu$m sizes, the preform was produced by printing acetone-based furfuryl resin binder. The bulk d. and open porosity of the resulting preform was 0.6 g cm-3 and 48{\%}, resp. The binder printing conditions during preform fabrication mostly detd. the preform microstructure. Pressureless reactive infiltration of such preforms at 1450°C in nitrogen atm. formed a SiC-Si composite with a coarse-SiC grain structure. Some residual carbon remained inside the SiC grains in this reaction bonded SiC-C due to sluggish reactivity of the larger carbon powder particles. Relatively complex-shaped carbon preforms with overhang, undercut, and inner channel structures were produced, demonstrating the capability of the 3DP process. A functionally graded SiC-Si composite was also fabricated, by varying carbon-yielding binder dosage during the preform fabrication, in order to control the spatial SiC concn. within the SiC-Si composite.

This paper provides a methodology for applying an open-source approach to design and development of a colorimeter. A 3-D printable, open-source colorimeter utilizing only open-source hardware and software solutions and readily available discrete components is discussed and its performance compared to a commercial portable colorimeter. Performance is evaluated with commercial vials prepared for the closed reflux chemical oxygen demand (COD) method. This approach reduced the cost of reliable closed reflux COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the vast majority of potential users. The open-source colorimeter demonstrated good reproducibility and serves as a platform for further development and derivation of the design for other, similar purposes such as nephelometry. This approach promises unprecedented access to sophisticated instrumentation based on low-cost sensors by those most in need of it, under-developed and developing world laboratories.},
annote = {Goal:
Provide a methodology for appliying an open source approach to design and development of a calorimeter. Performance is evaluated with commercial vials prepared for the closed reflux chemical oxygen demand COD method.

Conclusion:
Reduction of cost of realiable closed reflux COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the vast majority of potential users.
The outlook for development of scientific-grade instrumentation utiliwing the FOSS appraoach is extremely promising. Inexpensive open source 3D printers and free software have put one-off production of highly specialized tools within the grasp of the end user, bypassing historically expensive design and manufacturing steps.

This methodology eliminates cost as a barrier to adoption and makes the tools available to the broadest possible audience.

abstract = {The bioeconomy is expected to be a key solution to supply societies with food and non-food products while replacing non-renewable resources and preserving natural ones. Sustainability of bioeconomy systems is currently an issue that has to be addressed. Current research dealing with the bioeconomy focuses primarily on technologies to improve biomass transformation and, with regard to sustainability, on simple and unitary bio-based value chains such as biofuel production from a single crop. In this paper, based on a literature review, we highlight the complexity of bioeconomy systems and propose a framework to support their sustainable development. We first review the key characteristics of bioeconomy systems: a wide variety of stakeholders with a limited vision of bioeconomy systems, flexibility but also rigidity of biomass feedstocks or transformation processes and a complex spatio-temporal layout. Drawing on sustainability science, we show the relevance of the social-ecological concept to approach territorial bioeconomy systems' sustainably and develop an analytical framework to address sustainable development of territorial (local/regional) bioeconomy systems. This framework is based on two complementary representations of territorial bioeconomy systems, used to decipher their complexity. Finally, we outline an integrated assessment and modelling approach designed to tackle specific bioeconomy sustainability issues. This participatory approach has to take into account: i) the different sub-systems of territorial bioeconomy systems, their high level of interactions, their heterogeneity in terms of entities and processes involved and the circularity of matter and energy (production, transformation, use and recycling) with particular emphasis on the transformation sub-system and the logistics ii) the multiplicity and flexibility of stakeholders' nature, strategies and concerns, iii) the variety of spatial and temporal scales at play; iv) the effects of exogenous drivers like supra-regional policies and regulations, markets (e.g. prices of energies and biomass-based products) and climate.},

abstract = {Purpose: A low-cost, open source, self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) has been developed, which greatly expands the potential user base of rapid prototypers. The operating cost of the RepRap can be further reduced using waste polymers as feedstock. Centralized recycling of polymers is often uneconomic and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. This paper provides a proof of concept for high-value recycling of waste polymers at distributed creation sites. Approach: Previous designs of waste plastic extruders (also known as RecycleBots) were evaluated using a weighted evaluation matrix. An updated design was completed and the description and analysis of the design is presented including component summary, testing procedures, a basic life cycle analysis and extrusion results. The filament was tested for consistency of density and diameter while quantifying electricity consumption. Findings: Filament was successfully extruded at an average rate of 90 mm/min and used to print parts. The filament averaged 2.805mm diameter with 87{\%} of samples between 2.540mm and 3.081mm. The average mass was 0.564 g/100mm length. Energy use was 0.06 kWh/m. Originality: This paper reports on the first technical evaluation of a feedstock filament for the RepRap from waste plastic material made in a distributed recycling device. Practical Implications: The success of the RecycleBot further reduces RepRap operating costs, which enables distributed in-home, value added, plastic recycling. This has implications for municipal waste management programs as in-home recycling could reduce cost and greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste collection and transportation as well as the environmental impact of manufacturing custom plastic parts},

abstract = {Compatibilized and non-compatibilized blends of polypropylene (PP) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) with various compositions containing nanoclay particles were prepared by one step melt compounding in a twin screw extruder. Two nanocomposite systems with different matrices i.e. PP-rich (75/25 composition) containing Cloisite 15A and PLA-rich (25/75 composition) containing Cloisite 30B were selected for investigation of effect of nanoclays and n-butyl acrylate glycidyl methacrylate ethylene terpolymers (PTW) as compatibilizer on mechanical properties of PP/PLA/clay nanocomposites. Tensile and impact properties of the nanocomposite systems were investigated and correlated with their microstructures. Tensile modulus and strength of the blends were increased while elongation at break decreased by increasing PLA content. There was an irregular relationship between impact strength of the blends and PLA content. Several proposed models for blends and nanocomposites were used for prediction of tensile modulus of the samples. Most of the proposed models for blends could predict the tensile modulus of the blends successfully at low content of PLA. Another notable point was that most of the micromechanical models for nanocomposites fitted well to experimental values at low content of the clays and showed deviations at high clay loadings.},

New opportunities for industrial integration of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies are identified, including AM of large polymeric parts. The PPBAM process consists of adapting a pellet-fed extrusion mechanism to a displacement system, either a Cartesian mechanism or a robotic arm system, building parts in a multi-layered approach. This use is justified by the extruded filament sizes required and the material costs when facing large-format prints. In this article, a pellet extrusion based printer prototype is presented together with a case study. The case study consists of the development of a two cubic meter capacity plastic part for the naval industry with a topology optimization design approach and material selection and validation methodology for a large-volume pellet based extrusion system.

abstract = {Purpose - Closing the loop at the end of products' useful life is earning increased attention from industry and academia. The recent or upcoming enactment of regulations regarding the management of end-of-life products is forcing manufacturers to consider strategies to increase the residual value of the products they make. Facilitating the residual value extraction process for end-of-life products is a challenging issue deserving investigation. This paper proposes to investigate this issue. Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyzes empirical evidence from a sample of 205 environmentally responsive SMEs operating in the fabricated metal products and electric/electronic products industries. A coherent research model is developed which classifies the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) activities along two dimensions, the forward and reverse supply chains. Findings - This first proposed taxonomy has been shown to be relevant for both sectors. The results also demonstrate that firms' abilities to implement CLSC environmental initiatives vary in their intensity and in their locus along the product value chain. Furthermore, benefits derived from these initiatives seem to vary according to the strategy favored by the firms. Originality/value - This research is valuable for those firms interested in implementing CLSC strategies in a synergistic manner with their forward supply chain. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {The embedding and promotion of social change is faced with a paradoxical challenge. In order to mainstream an approach to social change such as responsible research and innovation (RRI) and make it into a practical reality rather than an abstract ideal, we need to have conceptual clarity and empirical evidence. But, in order to be able to gather empirical evidence, we have to presuppose that the approach already exists in practice. This paper proposes a social lab methodology that is suited to deal with this circularity. The methodology combines the defining features of social labs emerging from the literature such as agility and real-world focus with established theories and approaches such as action research and experiential learning. Thereby it enables the parallel investigation and propagation of RRI. The framework thus constructed provides a theoretical embedding of social labs and overcomes some of the known limitations of the constitutive approaches.},

A new lab type, a Systemic Innovation Lab, is proposed which combines the features of existing labs that are suited to addressing wicked problems. Design/methodology/approach Characteristics of initiatives that are considered appropriate for addressing wicked problems and existing lab types that contain any of these characteristics are identified. These lab types are Social Innovation Labs, Living Labs, Urban Living Labs, Urban Transition Labs and Public Sector Innovation Labs. The proposed new lab type is reasoned by combining the features of existing labs that are suited to addressing wicked problems. How the new lab would work in practice is illustrated with a case study. Findings When addressing wicked problems, labs need to take a systemic design and not a service design approach. They also need to focus on addressing complex problems, take a place-based and transition approach, enable coherent action by diverse actors, involve users as co-creators, support a networked governance approach and recognize government as an enabler of change.

abstract = {This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of the potential of Social Innovation (SI) for social transformation. Being a popular concept, SI has been discussed for decades, increasingly recognized for its complexity. A systematic review of the literature on SI was undertaken to understand the state-of-the-art, the evolution of the concept and its core underpinnings in order to meet the research aim of this paper. The literature is relatively broad in relation to general characteristics of SI and contexts where it is happening, but the use of the 'social innovation' term often reveals semantic problems, generating multiple, interchangeable and mixed understandings. In this paper, we identify and discuss two ways of using SI in the literature: (i) one that favours the materialization of SI, as something tangible that can be observed, measured and systematically analysed; we called this a cartesian approach; and (ii) another that uses systemic thinking focussing on successful factors of SI to enhance its transformative capacity in existing system(s) through change in routines, resources, and beliefs; we called this a disruptive approach. While still emerging in SI literature the academic discussion about SI dynamics and its transformative capacity is increasingly addressed by scholars. We conclude the paper by arguing that more transformative-driven and systemic SI may enhance its potential to lead change, while it only creates transformation when it scales-up or out, and when it has durability and transformative impact.},

However, sustaining an innovation lab is a challenging task that requires more than well-meant intentions.

Building on an existing framework, this article focuses on a case study of the ViveLab Bogot{\'{a}}, an innovation lab in the Colombian public sector. The results reveal that having a clear and shared strategic intent, effective governance mechanisms, a defined financial model, continuous knowledge generation and a community-based approach, are factors that may enable or limit an innovation lab to experience a sustainable evolution. Finally, reflections are also shared on the use of the selected framework and possible points for improvement.},

abstract = {The struggle to solve local and global issues often appears to pitch large corporations and governments against activists, artists, workers and ordinary citizens. But what happens when these entities consciously join forces and share resources to create social change? It's happening more than you might think-in a growing phenomenon known as social innovation labs. And Labcraft offers an intimate picture of this new and evolving landscape-where seemingly disparate stakeholders network and align as learning communities who collaborate for positive change. Social labs do what we expect laboratories to do-invent and experiment. But their "test tubes" are real-world challenges. And as they explore new connections, new ideas, and new initiatives, they often generate new perspectives and promising solutions. A fittingly collaborative effort in itself, Labcraft was written in a four-day "Book Sprint" by representatives from seven innovation labs from around the world. These practitioners share their stories, experiences and perspectives, and consider their commonalities and differences. They offer humble observations about their struggles and successes, and detail how they navigate their unique dilemmas and paradoxes. From workspaces and funding to impact measurement and power dynamics, Labcraft explores what it takes to cultivate a nimble and responsive environment-and gives a face to the poignant potential of these creative new collaborations. Change makers everywhere will be uplifted and inspired by this hopeful, fascinating window into emerging frontiers for building a better world.},

abstract = {The aim of this research is to explore the dynamics and impact of open social innovation, within the context of fab labs and makerspaces. Using an exploratory methodology based on 12 semi-structured interviews of fab lab founders belonging to The Centres for Maker Innovation and Technology (CMIT) programme – a network of 170 fab labs located in Eastern Europe – this research explores the impact of an adopting an open approach in relation to the different stages of social innovation (prompts, proposals, prototypes, sustaining, scaling and diffusion, systemic change) as well as social impact. The main results of this study are that while the CMIT programme provided each fab lab with similar initial conditions (identical funding, objectives and rules), the open social innovation approached adopted enabled to give birth to a wide diversity of fab labs, each being very well adapted to the local environment, social needs and constraints and able to deliver social impact in just a matter of years; a result that would be hard to achieve with a centralised top-down approach. The study identified three types of CMITs – Education, Industry and Residential – which could be similar or different depending on the stage of social open innovation. Furthermore, this paper discusses the main difficulties social entrepreneurs encounter as a part of the open social innovation process, as well as means to overcome them. In this respect, this study adds to the literature on fab labs by providing more comprehensive view of the challenges faced by fab labs (and makerspaces) founders, as well as suggestions of strategies enabling to ensure their long-term sustainability.},

The answers to these questions promote reflection on the future of innovation spaces, particularly an analysis of whether a model of ‘siloed' innovation spaces will survive in the humanitarian system. The paper demonstrates the important role that innovation labs play in the UN system, as well as grappling with the challenges they face.},

This article builds on the recently developed Transformative Social Innovation (TSI) theory to propose a conceptual framework and research agenda for understanding and investigating the roles and limits of network leadership in supporting learning processes that serve to develop the transformative capacity of social innovation. This focus on network leadership is underdeveloped so far in TSI theory. Addressing this research gap also serves to increase the practical relevance of TSI theory to practitioners engaged in network leadership. After presenting a synopsis of TSI theory, we present an overview of the elements of the conceptual framework, which are successively specified throughout the article. First, transformative change is conceptualized, involving three institutional dimensions: depth, width and length. Based on this, a definition of transformative capacity is proposed that addresses change across these three dimensions. We then describe how various types of learning processes can contribute to the development of transformative capacity. Next, we outline the roles of network leadership in supporting these learning processes across various network levels. We conclude with a research agenda for empirically investigating these roles of network leaders as agents for advancing transformative changes for sustainability.},

The study utilizes four approaches to roles: structuralist, symbolic interactionist, resource-based, and action-based approaches. Our empirical analysis of 26 living labs in four different countries identifies a number of actor roles associated with open innovation. In addition, it reveals four role patterns characteristic of living labs: (i) ambidexterity, (ii) reciprocity, (iii) temporality, and (iv) multiplicity. These patterns distinguish actor collaboration in networks characterized by heterogeneous actors, the coexistence of individual and shared motives, high degree of openness, and user involvement. Scholars and practitioners of innovation learn that understanding of role patterns in living labs can contribute to building, utilization, and orchestration of open innovation networks. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

As a laboratory for sustainability education and innovation we have developed a transdisciplinary, community-engaged, upper-division undergraduate course that engages students in participatory research on the inextricably linked dimensions of social sustainability. Collaborating with community partners to work across networks, disciplines, and institutions, students have the opportunity to ameliorate real problems in the local community. In doing so, the course confronts students and the instructor with a series of robust challenges from intensive collaborations, to logistical and time-management dilemmas, to real-world execution issues.

abstract = {In this paper, we study the influence of innovator roles in highly innovative ventures. In order to obtain a differentiated picture we take into account the degree of innovativeness as a moderating variable. To test our hypotheses we use a sample of 146 highly innovative new product development projects. We choose a rigorous sampling design and apply state-of-the-art measures for the degree of innovativeness. Furthermore, we apply multi-trait-multi-method methodology (MTMM) to enhance the validity of our study. The results show that innovator roles have a strong influence on innovation success but these influences are positively and negatively moderated by innovativeness. The moderating influences depend on the type of innovativeness. Remarkably, with increasing technological innovativeness innovator roles which create inter-organizational links with the outside world appear to be more important than intra-organizational linker roles, and support from high-ranked organizational members turns out to have a significant negative effect on project success with higher degrees of technological innovativeness. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed and consequences for innovation research and innovation management are shown. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Since 2007, the team led by Dr. Frances Westley at the Waterloo Institute for Social Innovation and Resilience (WISIR), in collaboration with many colleagues, including those within the Canada's Social Innovation Generation (SiG) partnership, have been generating and sharing new knowledge about how significant change happens in the world. WISIR's interest in the possibility of processes that catalyze real and durable innovation has driven a number of years of exploring the potential of 'Labs'. The Social Innovation Lab emphasizes not only imagining high potential interventions but also gaining system sight, redefining problems, and identifying opportunities in the broader context with the potential to tip systems in positive directions. It is a three-step process of developing, testing and instigating innovation strategies. It requires the right starting conditions, an investment in research and skilled facilitators. It also makes use of computer modeling to proto-typing interventions in complex systems. Like other processes for convening multi-stakeholder groups working on complex challenges, it is best suited to the early stages of making change. This guide is offered as a resource to peers, colleagues, practitioners, leaders from all sectors, and concerned citizens - all who have and/or will participate in change-making processes. One hope for this work is that these ideas on Social Innovation and these recommendations for new practice will result in greater sense of agency for those who work on what often seems like impossible aspirations for a different, better world. Probably our greatest hope is that these ideas help to transform the impossible into the possible.},

abstract = {Ashoka: Innovators for the PublicTM was set up 25 yr ago by Bill Drayton, recently voted by the Centre for Public Leadership at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in collaboration with US News and World Report among America's 25 Best Leaders. Ashoka coined the term 'social entrepreneur'. Its first insight was that there was nothing more powerful than a big social idea, but only if it is in the hands of a first-class social entrepreneur. The organisation works as a social venture capital fund, helping selected 'Fellows' with start-up funds to launch their ideas. The Fellows' direct impact is only the beginning; they are role models who inspire others to become active Changemakers. Ashoka weaves them together into a global community whose collaborations are far more powerful than the sum of its solo practitioner parts. This paper examines the evolution of Ashoka, its role as a driver of social change, and the various collaborations and institutions it has helped build and is still in the process of building to promote social entrepreneurship. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Social Innovation Labs (SILs) are a recent policymaking development that are spreading rapidly in many different countries. SILs are said to address difficult and complex social policy problems that have been resistant to solutions. To date, there has been limited scholarly analysis of SIL development, with many questions in need of critical policy assessment. This paper seeks to conceptualize SILs in the Canadian context by mapping the sector and exploring how these labs fit within the broader ecosystem of policy innovation. We consider why SILs have become so popular in this particular socio-political moment. We contend that the SIL trend speaks to a dual and contradictory desire on the part of governments for more participatory policymaking and cost saving. Thus, while SILs may create opportunities for the democratization of social policy, they are also motivated by efforts to do more with less in an environment shaped by austerity and neoliberalism. This suggests that SILs could equally result in the marketization and depoliticization of social policy. This paper highlights these tensions conceptually with the purpose of guiding empirical studies that explore how these contradictions may manifest in policy practice and perhaps offer openings for policy that addresses both the roots and symptoms of complex social policy problems.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to clarify the multiple different approaches of social innovation, focusing on francophone literature. Originality/gap/relevance/implications: We propose an in-depth literature review that questions the meaning of the adjective "social" when used by authors to qualify an innovation, that highlights the different approaches of the concept, their relations to each other and their limits, and that illustrates these approaches with concrete examples. Finally, we build on these materials to propose a new innovation typology that wholly integrates social innovation. Key methodological aspects: The literature review is based on a selection of 25 papers in French - the mother language of the author - which were collected and analyzed using the "theoretical saturation point" method: we stopped the review when we felt there was no new crucial element in the next articles read, that is, when it seemed that a "saturation point" of information had been reached about theories on social innovation. Summary of key results: The definition of social innovation as new answers provided to unsatisfied or badly-satisfied social demands seems to prevail in the literature. It can be divided into three sub-approaches: the public policies, the social entrepreneurship, and the participatory dynamics, which strikes us as the most interesting, without excluding the others. Key considerations/conclusions: We propose a new innovation typology, which presents social innovation's relations to other types of innovation. We conclude with some considerations about social innovation context of emergence, and about its ambiguous position in the neoliberal system.RESUMEN Objetivo: El objetivo de este art{\'{i}}culo es clarificar las diversas visiones de la innovaci{\'{o}}n social, concentr{\'{a}}ndose en la literatura franc{\'{o}}fona.

Por fin, utilizamos este material para sugerir una nueva tipolog{\'{i}}a de la innovaci{\'{o}}n social, que toma plenamente en cuenta la innovaci{\'{o}}n social.

In spite of the increasing popularity of this novel approach to intellectual property in product innovation, practice communities have faced difficulties to refine this concept into sharp and practical terms. There is to date no widely acknowledged criteria for determining whether a product is open source or not. Assuming OSH follows the same development path as Open Source Software and becomes a mainstream approach, the issue of conformance will also become critical for both producers and consumers. To address this gap, this contribution introduces a self-declared product openness marking scheme allowing to rate the openness of a product. Looking forward, it provides conceptual inputs for the future establishment of technical standards bringing clarity in this emerging and moving field.},

Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.},

abstract = {This study reports on the results of a systematic literature review on ‘open design' in academic fields including and beyond design and HCI. The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and open-source design (including ‘open hardware'): how researchers contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself ‘making,' manufacturing and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues around open design community governance and ownership, safety and reliability of open outcomes require further investigation.},

abstract = {Open Source Hardware (OSH) products are those whose design are made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell them. In spite of the increasing popularity of this novel approach to intellectual property in product innovation, practice communities have faced difficulties to refine this concept into sharp and practical terms. There is to date no widely acknowledged criteria for determining whether a product is open source or not. Assuming OSH follows the same development path as Open Source Software and becomes a mainstream approach, the issue of conformance will also become critical for both producers and consumers. To address this gap, this contribution introduces a self-declared product openness marking scheme allowing to rate the openness of a product. Looking forward, it provides conceptual inputs for the future establishment of technical standards bringing clarity in this emerging and moving field.},

On the one side, we have a re-emergence of the co-operative movement and worker-owned enterprises which suffer from certain structural weaknesses. On the other, we have an emergent field of open and Commons-oriented peer production initiatives which create common pools of knowledge for the whole of humanity, but are dominated by start-ups and large multinational enterprises using the same Commons. Thus we have a paradox: the more communist the sharing license used in the peer production of free software or open hardware, the more capitalist the practice. To tackle this paradox and the aforementioned contradictions, we tentatively suggest a new convergence that would combine both Commons-oriented open peer production models with common ownership and governance models, such as those of the co-operatives and the solidarity economic models.},

To prepare for the next pandemic, this study reviews the state-of-the-art of open hardware designs needed in a COVID-19-like pandemic. It evaluates the readiness of the top twenty technologies requested by the Government of India. The results show that the majority of the actual medical products have some open source development, however, only 15{\%} of the supporting technologies required to produce them are freely available. The results show there is still considerable research needed to provide open source paths for the development of all the medical hardware needed during pandemics. Five core areas of future research are discussed, which include (i) technical development of a wide-range of open source solutions for all medical supplies and devices, (ii) policies that protect the productivity of laboratories, makerspaces, and fabrication facilities during a pandemic, as well as (iii) streamlining the regulatory process, (iv) developing Good-Samaritan laws to protect makers and designers of open medical hardware, as well as to compel those with knowledge that will save lives to share it, and (v) requiring all citizen-funded research to be released with free and open source licenses.},

Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of sci- entific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science.},

This is a problem when designing control systems with a limited budget, which are created, for example, in developing countries or small businesses. Currently, there have been opportunities to create low-cost automation systems by using solutions distributed on the basis of open-source and open-hardware. The work reviews the most important solutions and presents examples of their use in automation systems.},

@article{Pearce2016,
abstract = {The availability of free and open source hardware designs that can be replicated with low-cost 3D printers provides large values to scientists who need highly-customized low-volume production scientific equipment. Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of sci- entific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science.},

@article{Bonvoisin2018,
abstract = {Open Source Hardware (OSH) is an increasingly viable approach to intellectual property management extending the principles of Open Source Software (OSS) to the domain of physical products. These principles support the development of products in transparent processes allowing the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices filling a continuum between public and private development settings. They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the expansion of the open source development model from software into the realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices, techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate responses.},
